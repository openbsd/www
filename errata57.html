<p>
Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch is cryptographically signed with the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-5.7/signify.1">signify(1)</a> tool and contains
usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
<a href="https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/5.7.tar.gz">tar.gz file</a>
for convenience.

<p>
Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
<a href="stable.html">-stable branch</a>.

<li id="p001_sparc64_miniroot">
<strong>001: INSTALL ISSUE: May 1, 2015</strong>
&nbsp; <i>sparc64</i><br>
The "miniroot" install method is broken (related to the addition of
softraid support).  This method is used by the official CD 3 as
well, so it fails to boot on sparc64 machines.
<br>
No patch is available for obvious reasons, so use a different install method.
