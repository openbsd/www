OpenSSH 4.1 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support to the project, especially those who contributed source and
bought T-shirts or posters.

We have a new design of T-shirt available, more info on
        http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html#18

Changes since OpenSSH 4.0:
============================ 

* This is a bugfix release, no new features have been added. Some notable
  fixes are:

  - Fix segfault when using forwardings configured in ssh_config(5) and 
    ClearAllForwardings (bugzilla #996)

  - Limit input buffer size for channels. A peer could send more data
    than the buffer code was willing to accept. This would cause OpenSSH
    to abort the connection (bugzilla #896)

* Several improvements to the regression tests

* Portable OpenSSH:

  - OpenSSH will now always normalise IPv4 in IPv6 mapped addresses back to 
    IPv4 addresses. This means that IPv4 addresses in log messages on IPv6
    enabled machines will no longer be prefixed by "::ffff:" and AllowUsers,
    DenyUsers, AllowGroups, DenyGroups will match IPv4-style addresses only 
    for 4-in-6 mapped connections. This ensures a consistent representation
    of IPv4 addresses regardless of whether or not the machine is IPv6
    enabled.

* Other bugfixes, including bugzilla #950, #997, #998, #999, #1005, #1006, 
  #1024, and #1038

Changes since OpenSSH 3.9:
============================ 

* ssh(1) now allows the optional specification of an address to bind to 
  in port forwarding connections (local, remote and dynamic). Please 
  refer to the documentation for the -L and -R options in the ssh(1) 
  manual page and the LocalForward and RemoteForward options in the 
  ssh_config(5) manpage. (Bugzilla #413)

* To control remote bindings while retaining backwards compatibility,
  sshd(8)'s GatewayPorts option has been extended. To allow client
  specified bind addresses for remote (-R) port forwardings, the server
  must be configured with "GatewayPorts clientspecified".

* ssh(1) and ssh-keyscan(1) now support hashing of host names and 
  addresses added to known_hosts files, controlled by the ssh(1) 
  HashKnownHosts configuration directive. This option improves user 
  privacy by hiding which hosts have been visited. At present this 
  option is off by default, but may be turned on once it receives 
  sufficient testing.

* Added options for managing keys in known_hosts files to ssh-keygen(1),
  including the ability to search for hosts by name, delete hosts by
  name and convert an unhashed known_hosts file into one with hashed
  names. These are particularly useful for managing known_hosts files
  with hashed hostnames.

* Improve account and password expiry support in sshd(8). Ther server 
  will now warn in advance for both account and password expiry.

* sshd(8) will now log the source of connections denied by AllowUsers,
  DenyUsers, AllowGroups and DenyGroups (Bugzilla #909)

* Added AddressFamily option to sshd(8) to allow global control over
  IPv4/IPv6 usage. (Bugzilla #989)

* Improved sftp(1) client, including bugfixes and optimisations for the 
  ``ls'' command and command history and editing support using libedit.

* Improved the handling of bad data in authorized_keys files,
  eliminating fatal errors on corrupt or very large keys. (Bugzilla
  #884)

* Improved connection multiplexing support in ssh(1). Several bugs 
  have been fixed and a new "command mode" has been added to allow the
  control of a running multiplexing master connection, including 
  checking that it is up, determining its PID and asking it to exit.

* Have scp(1) and sftp(1) wait for the spawned ssh to exit before they
  exit themselves.  This prevents ssh from being unable to restore 
  terminal modes (not normally a problem on OpenBSD but common with 
  -Portable on POSIX platforms). (Bugzilla #950)

* Portable OpenSSH:

  - Add *EXPERIMENTAL* BSM audit support for Solaris systems 
    (Bugzilla #125)

  - Enable IPv6 on AIX where possible (see README.platform for
    details), working around a misfeature of AIX's getnameinfo. 
    (Bugzilla #835)

  - Teach sshd(8) to write failed login records to btmp for
    unsuccessful auth attempts. Currently this is only for password,
    keyboard-interactive and challenge/response authentication methods
    and only on Linux and HP-UX.

  - sshd(8) now sends output from failing PAM session modules to the 
    user before exiting, similar to the way /etc/nologin is handled

  - Store credentials from gssapi-with-mic authentication early enough
    to be available to PAM session modules when privsep=yes.
