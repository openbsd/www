OpenSSH 2.9 has just been uploaded. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

This release contains many portability bug-fixes (listed in the
ChangeLog) as well as several new features (listed below).

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support and encouragement.

Important Changes:
==================

WARNING: SSH protocol v2 is now the default protocol version

	use the 'Protocol' option from ssh(1) and sshd(8) if
	you want to change this.

SSH protocol v2 implementation adds support for:

        HostbasedAuthentication, similar to RhostsRSA in SSH protocol
        v1

        Rekeying (negotiate new encryption keys for the current SSH
        session, try ~R in interactive SSH sessions)

        updated DH group exchange:
        	draft-ietf-secsh-dh-group-exchange-01.txt

        client option HostKeyAlgorithms

        server options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax

        tty mode passing

general:

        gid swapping in sshd (fixes access to /home/group/user based
        directory structures)

        Dan Kaminsky <dankamin@cisco.com> contributed an experimental
        SOCKS4 proxy to the ssh client (yes, client not the server).
        Use 'ssh -D 1080 server' if you want to try this out.

	server option PrintLastLog

	improvements for scp > 2GB

	improved ListenAddress option.
	You can now use ListenAddress host:port

	improved interoperability (bug detection for older implementations)

	improved documentation
