OpenSSH 3.7 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0
implementation and includes sftp client and server support.

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued
support to the project, especially those who contributed source and
bought T-shirts or posters.

We have a new design of T-shirt available, more info on
        http://www.openbsd.org/tshirts.html#18

Security Changes:
=================

  All versions of OpenSSH's sshd prior to 3.7 contain a buffer
  management error.  It is uncertain whether this error is
  potentially exploitable, however, we prefer to see bugs
  fixed proactively.

  OpenSSH 3.7 fixes this bug.

Changes since OpenSSH 3.6.1:
============================ 

* The entire OpenSSH code-base has undergone a license review. As
  a result, all non-ssh1.x code is under a BSD-style license with no
  advertising requirement. Please refer to README in the source
  distribution for the exact license terms.

* Rhosts authentication has been removed in ssh(1) and sshd(8).

* Changes in Kerberos support:

    - KerberosV password support now uses a file cache instead of
      a memory cache.

    - KerberosIV and AFS support has been removed.

    - KerberosV support has been removed from SSH protocol 1.

    - KerberosV password authentication support remains for SSH
      protocols 1 and 2.

    - This release contains some GSSAPI user authentication support
      to replace legacy KerberosV authentication support. At present
      this code is still considered experimental and SHOULD NOT BE
      USED.
  
* Changed order that keys are tried in public key authentication.
  The ssh(1) client tries the keys in the following order:

     1. ssh-agent(1) keys that are found in the ssh_config(5) file
     2. remaining ssh-agent(1) keys
     3. keys that are only listed in the ssh_config(5) file

  This helps when an ssh-agent(1) has many keys, where the sshd(8)
  server might close the connection before the correct key is tried.

* SOCKS5 support has been added to the dynamic forwarding mode
  in ssh(1).

* Removed implementation barriers to operation of SSH over SCTP.

* sftp(1) client can now transfer files with quote characters in
  their filenames.

* Replaced sshd(8)'s VerifyReverseMapping with UseDNS option.
  When UseDNS option is on, reverse hostname lookups are always
  performed.

* Fix a number of memory leaks.

* Support for sending tty BREAK over SSH protocol 2.

* Workaround for other vendor bugs in KEX guess handling.

* Support for generating KEX-GEX groups (/etc/moduli) in ssh-keygen(1).

* Automatic re-keying based on amount of data sent over connection.

* New AddressFamily option on client to select protocol to use (IPv4
  or IPv6).

* Experimental support for the "aes128-ctr", "aes192-ctr", and
  "aes256-ctr" ciphers for SSH protocol 2.

* Experimental support for host keys in DNS (draft-ietf-secsh-dns-xx.txt).
  Please see README.dns in the source distribution for details.

* Portable OpenSSH:

    - Replace PAM password authentication kludge with a more correct
      PAM challenge-response module from FreeBSD.

    - PAM support may now be enabled/disabled at runtime using the
      UsePAM directive.

    - Many improvements to the OpenSC smartcard support.

    - Regression tests now work with portable OpenSSH.
      Please refer to regress/README.regress in the source distribution.

    - On platforms that support it, portable OpenSSH now honors the
      UMASK, PATH and SUPATH attributes set in /etc/default/login.

    - Deny access to locked accounts, regardless of authentication
      method in use.
