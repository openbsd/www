OpenSSH 3.3 has just been released. It will be available from the
mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol version 1.3, 1.5 and 2.0

We would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued

Changes since OpenSSH 3.2.3:
============================ 

Security Changes:
=================

- improved support for privilege separation:

	privilege separation is now enabled by default

  See UsePrivilegeSeparation in sshd_config(5)
  and http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html for more
  information.
- ssh no longer needs to be installed setuid root for protocol
  version 2 hostbased authentication, see ssh-keysign(8).
  protocol version 1 rhosts-rsa authentication still requires privileges
  and is not recommended.

  been moved to ssh_config(5) and sshd_config(5).

  default to no, see ssh_config(5).
- the client options FallBackToRsh and UseRsh are deprecated.
