<h1>SSH agent restriction</h1>

<h2>TLDR</h2>
<p>
OpenSSH 8.9 will include the ability to control how and where keys in
<span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span> may be used, both locally and when forwarded (subject to some
<a href="#limitations">limitations</a>).
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
The OpenSSH SSH protocol implementation includes the <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span>
authentication agent. This tool supports two overlapping uses: a safe
runtime store for unwrapped private keys, removing the need to enter a
passphrase for each use, and a way to forward access to private keys to
remote hosts, without exposing the private keys themselves.
</p>
<p>
The agent is a deliberately simple program, since it holds private
keys we consider it part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base">TCB</a> and so want to minimise its attack
surface. It speaks a simple, client-initiated <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-miller-ssh-agent">protocol</a> with a small
number of operations including adding or deleting keys, retrieving
a list of public halves for loaded keys and, critically, making a
signature using a private key. Most interactions with the agent are
through the <a class="cmd" href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add</a> tool for adding, deleting and listing keys and <span class="cmd">ssh</span>,
which can use keys held in an agent for user authentication, but other
tools can also be used if they speak the protocol.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned above, access to the agent can be forwarded to a remote
host. Typically this happens by a SSH client and server arranging to
allow remote programs to establish a connection to a local agent and
exchange messages over that connection. A forwarded agent appears
effectively identical to a local one, as (until now) the protocol
offered no way to distinguish between them.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, because the agent holds sensitive keys, it is a desirable
and frequently-exploited target for attackers. A typical scenario begins
with a user forwarding their agent to a host that is controlled by an
attacker. Once this occurs, the attacker has full use of the keys held
in the agent and they will typically use them to authenticate a SSH
connection to a host they'd like to access.
</p>
<p>
While it is generally better for users to avoid the use of a forwarded
agent altogether (e.g. using the ProxyJump directive),
the agent protocol itself has offered little defence against this sort of
attack. It is possible to make keys auto-expire after a time period
or mark a key as requiring confirmation (via a popup window) for each
use, but these are seldom used and confirmation is somewhat easy to
phish, e.g. if an attacker knows when a user is likely to be making
SSH connections - unfortunately the confirmation popups can offer no
information on the destination host being authenticated to or the
forwarding path the request arrived over. FIDO keys that require
user-presence confirmation offer a little more defence, but are also
similarly phishable.
</p>
<h2>What would be better?</h2>
<p>
Thinking about what would be a better set of controls lets us identify
some possible requirements for a safer agent protocol.
</p>
<p>
An easy win for improving the security of the agent would be to provide
better separation between the two use-cases mentioned above. Adding a
key to an agent for local use should not necessarily make it available
on a forwarded agent. This would let users store keys in the agent with
less worry that they might be used on a malicious host. So the first
requirement is being able to <span class="hl">add keys to an agent for local (i.e. not
forwarded) use only</span>.
</p>
<p>
Conversely, forwarded agents are useful too, but not all remote hosts
are equally trustworthy and users often connect to hosts in entirely
different trust domains (e.g. a user at a laptop connecting to testing,
production or personal environments). A good solution would <span class="hl">allow
forwarding varying subsets of keys to different remote hosts</span>.
</p>
<p>
Since forwarding chains sometimes involve several hops, we'd like
<span class="hl">key forwarding restrictions to be applied hop by hop</span>, with each
additional hop only ever removing keys from those available for use
at the destination. Having gone to the trouble of making a system
of restrictions that can reason about key availability based on the
forwarding path, it would also be good to <span class="hl">display path information in
confirmation dialogs</span>. E.g. a notification for a FIDO key could state the
destination host and the path over which the request was forwarded.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the whole purpose of this exercise is to make agent
forwarding more secure. In particular, the system should
<span class="hl">cryptographically guarantee that a key is never usable for
authentication to an unintended destination</span> and that <span class="hl">forwarded keys are
only visible/available through permitted hosts</span>. Finally, the system
should <span class="hl">fail safe</span> when some participant lacks the protocol features that
it needs to function.
</p>
<h2>Agent restriction in OpenSSH</h2>
<p>
OpenSSH 8.9 will include an experimental set of agent restrictions
that meet the above requirements, though with some caveats (<a href="#limitations">discussed
below</a>). These are built around some two simple agent protocol extensions
and a small modification to the public key authentication protocol.
</p>
<p>
These extensions allow the user to add <em>destination constraints</em> to keys they add to a <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span> and have <span class="cmd">ssh</span> enforce them. For example, this command:
</p>
<pre class="code">
$ ssh-add -h "perseus@cetus.example.org" \
          -h "scylla.example.org" \
          -h "scylla.example.org&gt;medea@charybdis.example.org" \
          ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
</pre>
<p>
Adds a key that can only be used for authentication in the following
circumstances:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>From the origin host to <span class="example">scylla.example.org</span> as any user.</li>
	<li>From the origin host to <span class="example">cetus.example.org</span> as user <span class="example">perseus</span>.</li>
	<li>Through <span class="example">scylla.example.org</span> to host <span class="example">charybdis.example.org</span> as user <span class="example">medea</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Attempts to use this key to authenticate to other hosts will be refused
by the agent because they weren't explicitly listed, as would an
attempt to authenticate through <span class="example">scylla.example.org</span> to <span class="example">cetus.example.org</span>
because the path was not permitted. Likewise, trying to authenticate
as any other user then <span class="example">perseus</span> to <span class="example">cetus.example.org</span> or <span class="example">medea</span> to
<span class="example">charybdis.example.org</span> would fail because the destination users are not
permitted.
</p>
<p>
Deeper chains of forwarding restrictions are possible, with each hop needing to be specified separately:
</p>
<pre class="code">
$ ssh-add -h "scylla.example.org" \
          -h "cetus.example.org" \
          -h "scylla.example.org&gt;charybdis.example.org" \
          -h "cetus.example.org&gt;charybdis.example.org" \
          -h "charybdis.example.org&gt;hydra.example.org" \
          ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
</pre>
<p>
Note that this set of restrictions permits two different paths by which
the ultimate destination of <span class="example">hydra.example.org</span> could be reached:

<p>
At each hop, only the keys that are permitted for use there are
visible. For example, if the user tried to list the available keys on
<span class="example">hydra.example.org</span>, this key would not be shown as available. Similarly,
attempts to remove or adjust options on a restricted key will be refused
anywhere other than on the origin machine.
</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<h3>Protocol extensions are required</h3>
<p>
The most immediate practical consideration is that this feature requires
protocol extensions in <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span>, <span class="cmd">ssh-add</span>, <span class="cmd">ssh</span> and <span class="cmd">sshd</span> for most
participating hosts. The requirement to run an updated <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span>, ssh
and <span class="cmd">ssh-add</span> is fairly obvious (older versions simply don't support
the feature), but the need to run an updated SSH server is less obvious
(the reason is <a href="#authverify">discussed below</a>) and is more likely to be a challenge to
deployment.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Permitted forwarding hosts are identified by hostkey</h3>
<p>
Another practical limitation is due to forwarding constraints
using hostkeys to identify allowed hosts. Hostkeys are the primary
way of identifying hosts within the SSH protocol, and the only
cryptographically-verifiable way that can be plumbed through to the
agent.
</p>
<p>
When adding a key with destination constraints, <span class="cmd">ssh-add</span> will use the
local <span class="file">known_hosts</span> files to map the host names given on the command-line
to hostkeys before passing them to <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span>. This means that all the
keys for all the hosts that the user lists must be present in the right
place (the machine running <span class="cmd">ssh-add</span>) and the right time
(when <span class="cmd">ssh-add</span> is run).
</p>
<p>
Hostkeys aren't always the easiest things to work with either. A host
may have multiple keys of different types, or have multiple names - such
as a fully-qualified domain name, an unqualified hostname or just an
address.
</p>
<p>
If you plan to make use of these new agent controls, then users will
need to maintain good control over their <span class="file">known_hosts</span> databases. OpenSSH
offers some features that might make this easier, including the
UpdateHostkey extension that allows a client to learn the full set of a
server's hostkeys (this has recently been enabled by default), and the
CanonicalizeHostname option that makes it easier for a client to store
and refer to fully-qualified hostnames when unqualified names are used.
</p>
<p>
The situation for certificate hostkeys is considerably simpler. If
certificate hostkeys are in use, then the host running <span class="cmd">ssh-add</span> only
needs the CA key(s) for the hosts listed in destination constraints, and
will be able to match certificates made by these CA keys by name. This
is another good reason to use host certificates in organisational
settings.
</p>
<h3 id="pathtrust">Destinations are much more trustworthy than paths</h3>
<p>
Destination constraints are checked by <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span>, using information
passed from a cooperating ssh. If an agent is forward to an
attacker-controlled host, then they will still be able to steal use of a
forwarded agent on that host.
</p>
<p>
Less obviously, they will also be able to forward use of the agent
to other hosts, e.g. by using an SSH implementation that doesn't
cooperate with <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span>, or another tool entirely, such as socat. Note
that the attacker isn't gaining any new access to keys here, they are
still forced to act via the compromised host and their access is still
restricted to the keys that were permitted for use though the intended
host only.
</p>
<p>
A related attack involves a malicious hop replaying session binding
messages (<a href="#pathtrust">see below</a>). They are able to do this because there is no way
for <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span> to guarantee freshness of these messages. This attack
allows a malicious hop to make the forwarding path appear longer than it
actually is.
</p>
<p>
In all cases however, the final destination cannot be forged because of
the <a href="#authverify">binding</a> between the signature and the server hostkey. Because the binding
is supplied by the local client, it's also reasonable to assume that the
the identity of the first hop in a forwarding path is correct too.
</p>
<p>
Because of these subtleties, it's better to think of key constraints
as permitting use of a key through a given host rather than as from a
particular host, and, more generally, that any forwarding path is only
as strong as its weakest link. Another helpful way to think about key
constraints is that each one represents a delegation of a key to a host,
that is only slightly more trustworthy than the delegate is.
</p>
<h3>Protocol extensions assume a particular sequence of operations</h3>
<p>
The restriction checking in <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span> makes strong assumptions on what
operations are performed over agent connections. This is only likely
to matter to authors of tools that interact with the agent protocol
directly.
</p>
<p>
In OpenSSH, one connection from the <span class="cmd">ssh</span> client to the agent is made for
user authentication, and this is closed after user authentication is
completed. When a SSH session with a forwarded agent is established,
additional agent connections are made as necessary when operations that
invoke the agent are performed (e.g. to list keys or authenticate to
another host).
</p>
<p>
The agent protocol extension deliberately treats the initial connection
that <span class="cmd">ssh</span> makes for authentication differently to connections made for
agent forwarding. Other SSH implementations that want to use these
extensions will have to follow this pattern.
</p>
<h3>Restrictions only work for user authentication</h3>
<p>
Destination restrictions in <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span> strongly depend on the agent being
able to parse the data being signed, and the contents having all the
information needed to compare against the restrictions listed for a
given key. SSH user authentication requests have a format that meets
these requirements, but other uses of the agent protocol are not likely
to.
</p>
<p>
In particular, it is currently not possible to use
destination-restricted keys for SSH signatures via <span class="cmd">ssh-keygen</span>, CA
operations, etc. It may be possible to relax this limitation
(<a href="#nextsteps">see below</a>).
</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>
Destination-restricted keys are implemented through three fairly simply
protocol extensions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A new agent protocol key constraint extension to allow communicating destination restrictions from <span class="cmd">ssh-add</span> to <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span>.</li>
	<li>A new agent protocol session binding extension to allow <span class="cmd">ssh</span> to inform <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span> of where keys are being used.</li>
	<li>A modified publickey authentication method used between <span class="cmd">ssh</span> and <span class="cmd">sshd</span> that incorporates the server hostkey into the signed data.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These protocol extensions ensure the new permission-checking logic agent
has all the requisite information that it needs to cryptographically
verify the intended destination for authentication requests and the path
over which it travelled.
</p>
<p>
A detailed specification for the wire format for each of these
extensions can be found via the OpenSSH source distribution's PROTOCOL
file.
</p>
<h3>Restricting keys</h3>
<p>
The protocol extensions begin with adding a destination-constrained key
to <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span> using the <span class="cmd">ssh-add</span> tool.
</p>
<p>
When requested to add a key with one or more constraints for use
to/through particular hosts, <span class="cmd">ssh-add</span> will look up the host's hostkeys
from the local <span class="file">known_hosts</span> database and encode them along with the key
in the <span class="msgtype">SSH2_AGENTC_ADD_IDENTITY</span> message. Specifically, one or more of
the following per-hop constraints will be encoded:
</p>
<pre class="proto">
byte         SSH_AGENT_CONSTRAIN_EXTENSION (0xff)
string       "restrict-destination-v00@openssh.com"
constraint[] constraints
 	string    [empty]
string    from_hostname
keyspec[] from_keyspec
    string    keyblob
    bool      key_is_ca
string    to_username
string    to_hostname
keyspec[] to_hostspec
    string    keyblob
    bool      key_is_ca
</pre>
<p>
<span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span> records each hop constraint against the key for later
permission checking. The hostnames in the constraint are used primarily
for hostname checking in certificate hostkeys (i.e. when key_is_ca is
true). The from_hostname and from_keyspec fields may be empty to signify
the origin host, but they are always mandatory for the to/through host.
</p>
<h3>Building the forwarding path</h3>
<p>
The path visible to <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span>, from the origin through forwarding hosts
to a destination authentication request is established by <span class="cmd">ssh</span> sending
a session binding message as the first message on an agent connection
after it is established. This message cryptographically links the SSH
connection's session identifier (as described in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4253#section-7.2">RFC4253 section 7.2</a>)
with the server's hostkey for the life of the agent connection. This
allows the agent to establish a trustworthy linkage between an agent
connection and a SSH connection.
</p>
<p>
The message format is:
</p>
<pre class="proto">
byte            SSH_AGENTC_EXTENSION (0x1b)
string          session-bind@openssh.com
string          hostkey
string          session identifier
string          signature
bool            is_forwarding
</pre>
<p>
Where the signature field is the server's signature over the session
identifier using its hostkey as sent in the final <span class="msgtype">SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY</span>
/ <span class="msgtype">SSH2_MSG_KEXECDH_REPLY</span> message of the initial client/server key
exchange. The is_forwarding flag indicates whether this binding is for a
forwarding (true) or for an authentication attempt (false).
</p>
<p>
When the agent receives this message, it verifies the signature using
the included hostkey and checks that the session identifier has not been
previously recorded on this connection. If these checks pass, then the
hostkey and session id are appended to the connection's binding list.
</p>
<p>
When an agent connection is requested across a deep forwarding path,
extending beyond the origin host, each SSH client will issue a binding
request as soon as it has received confirmation of a successfully opened
channel, and before it passes the channel on to the next hop. This
ensures that the binding list will be extended in the correct order, and
that it is only necessary to trust each hop's SSH client to do its job
properly.
</p>
<h3 id="authverify">Verifying an authentication attempt</h3>
<p>
To ensure that the agent has all the necessary information it needs to decide whether to allow an authentication attempt, the public key authentication request is extended to also include the server's host key:
</p>
<pre class="proto">
byte            SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
string          username
string          "ssh-connection"
string          "publickey-hostbound-v00@openssh.com"
bool            has_signature
string          pkalg
string          public key
string          server host key
string          signature [only if has_signature is true]
</pre>
<p>
Apart from the addition of the server host key field, this request is identical to the usual
"publickey" authentication request described in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4252#section-7">RFC4252</a>. When
an authentication attempt is made, the signature is made over the
concatenation of the connection's session identifier and the entire
<span class="msgtype">SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST</span> packet (this unchanged from the standard SSH
protocol).
</p>
<p>
To make an authentication request using the agent, the client will
pass the data to be signed to the agent via a <span class="msgtype">SSH2_AGENTC_SIGN_REQUEST</span>
message. <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span> can now attempt to parse the to-be-signed data and
extract the session identifier, server username and, thanks to the above
extension, server hostkey.
</p>
<p>
At this point, the agent has all the information it needs to strongly
identify the destination of an authentication request, and to relate
this to the binding list established during the previous step. The agent
will confirm that the signature request has been made along a permitted
forwarding path and to a permitted destination before completing it.
</p>
<p>
Inclusion of the hostkey in the signed data binds the signature to the
intended destination and prevents an attack where a MITM with access to
a hostkey for one permitted destination from signing session binding
requests for a different host.
</p>
<p>
Note that this hostkey binding is not required for the first-hop
connections, i.e. those originating from the host where the agent
is running. This allows non-transitive destination restrictions to
be useful to servers that do not support the host-bound signature
extension.
</p>
<p>
Support for host-bound signatures is signalled by the server to the
client using the <span class="msgtype">SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO</span> mechanism (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8308">RFC8308</a>) using the
following advertisement:

<h3>Fail-safe operation</h3>
<p>
This feature generally degrades safely (though not especially
gracefully) when hosts lack the necessary protocol extensions.
</p>
<p>
If the agent lacks destination constraint support, then attempting
to add a constrained key using <span class="cmd">ssh-add</span> will fail because all key
constraints are treated as critical, i.e. failure of an agent to support
one will cause failure of the operation.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned above, host-bound signature support is not required on the
first hop, but if the agent parses an unbound authentication request on
a forwarded connection then the operation will be refused.
</p>
<p>
One case where the protocol does not degrade so gracefully is if access
to the <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span> is forwarded from the origin machine by tools that
do not participate in the session binding protocol, to a host where
the tools do support session binding. As per the previously discussed
<a href="#pathtrust">limitation</a>, this is entirely invisible to the agent and could yield
surprises. This situation is little contrived, but might occur if
an old OpenSSH or non-OpenSSH implementation is used concurrently on
the client machine and it is active in agent forwarding.
</p>
<h2 id="nextsteps">Next steps</h2>
<p>
This is a new feature in OpenSSH and it is likely to evolve further. 
</p>
<p>
More path information will likely be shown in key confirmation and FIDO
touch/PIN request dialogs in future.
</p>
<p>
There is currently no communication for the reason signature requests
and other operations are refused by <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span> except debug logs that are
not visible by default. This makes troubleshooting difficult.
</p>
<p>
The user-interface as presented by <span class="cmd">ssh-add</span> might not be optimal for all
uses. In particular, users might want to specify whole forwarding chains
in a single argument. This was deliberately not implemented, as the
current hop-by-hop specification emphasises the delegatory aspect of hop
permissions, but it might be worth revisiting this.
</p>
<p>
The path information accrued in <span class="cmd">ssh-agent</span> could be used for more
expressive and fine-grained control of key availability than is
currently implemented. E.g. it could be possible to make keys available
on hosts towards the end of a forwarding path and not on initial
hosts. Similarly, "wildcard" forwarding of keys through a particular
host could be added, as could selective relaxation of the need for
servers to support host-bound public key authentication. However, these
come with additional caveats and MITM risks that would need to be
assessed and explained carefully.
</p>
<p>
Finally, it may also be possible to selectively allow signing requests
other than those used for user authentication. SSH keys are being used
for a growing number of signing operations, including git commits and
pull requests. It may be possible, for example, to permit a key for
forwarded use only for git signing. However, all trust would be placed
on the forwarding path as there is no intrinsic destination binding
analogous to that offered by host-bound signatures.
</p>
<h2>Alternatives considered</h2>
<h3>Separate agent sockets</h3>
<p>
A previous design for agent restriction had the agent offering multiple
sockets, and gave <span class="cmd">ssh-add</span> the ability to specify which of these sockets
that keys would be available on. In conjunction with the IdentityAgent
and ForwardAgent directives in ssh, this would give the ability to
make keys available for authentication to only specific hosts from the
origin, and to forward different subsets of keys to designated hosts.
</p>
<p>
However, this design required considerable manual configuration to
achieve this and offered no cryptographic guarantees of where keys could
be used.
</p>
<h3>Changes to agent protocol only (i.e. no server-side changes)</h3>
<p>
A previous version of this protocol included only changes to the agent
protocol and did not include the host-bound authentication method. This
earlier design had the advantage of not requiring servers to update, but
suffered from the re-signing attack described <a href="#pathtrust">above</a>.
</p>
<h3>Host-bound authentication and minimal agent protocol changes</h3>
<p>
Another potential variant of this protocol included the host-bound
authentication change, but removed the session binding mechanism. This
would allow the agent to strongly determine the destination of an
authentication request when it was made, but would give it no visibility
of the forwarding path over which it was made. This design was discarded
as offering too little control and of being too easy for a MITM to phish
requests against.
</p>
<h3>Hop by hop signing</h3>
<p>
Another alternative design involved <span class="cmd">sshd</span> in the protocol to a greater
extent, by having it sign forwarded agent messages it received with
its hostkey. This has the advantage of providing fresh signatures on
requests and avoids the path extension attack described <a href="#pathtrust">above</a>. However,
it requires that <span class="cmd">sshd</span> interpret the agent protocol (currently it does
not), and risks creating an exposed hostkey signing oracle unless very
carefully designed.
</p>
<h3>Host identification via name</h3>
<p>
This protocol uses hostkeys to identify hosts. It was suggested that,
with additional modifications to other parts of the SSH protocol,
hostnames could be used instead. Specifically, SSH servers could
assert a hostname during key exchange and these names could be
recorded in <span class="file">known_hosts</span> alongside the hostkey, rather than using
the destination hostname as entered by the user. Agent restrictions
could then potentially use these names instead of the more cumbersome
hostkeys. This option was not pursued as it would be a fairly
substantial modification to the SSH protocol, requiring modifications to
key exchange (or at least a new extension message) and hostkey storage.
</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
Q: Is it possible to modify a key's constraints once it has been added?
A: No, keys are immutable in the agent. You can replace the key with a new path though.
