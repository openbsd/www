<p>
OpenSSH is developed with the same rigorous security process that the
OpenBSD group is famous for. If you wish to report a security issue in
OpenSSH, please contact the private developers list &lt;<a href="mailto:openssh@openssh.com">openssh@openssh.com</a>&gt;.
<p>

<ul>
<li><strong>October 3, 2017</strong><br>
    All version of OpenSSH prior to 7.6 supporting read-only mode in sftp-server
    (introduced in 5.5).
    Incorrect open(2) flags in sftp-server permitted creation
    of zero-length files when the server was running in read-only mode (invoked
    using the -R command-line flag).
    <br>
    This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 7.6.
    For more information, please refer to the
    <a href="txt/release-7.6">release notes</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>March 9, 2016</strong><br>
    All versions of OpenSSH prior to 7.2p2 with X11Forwarding
    enabled.
    Missing sanitisation of untrusted input allows an
    authenticated user who is able to request X11 forwarding
    to inject commands to xauth(1).
    <p>
    Mitigate by setting <b>X11Forwarding=no</b> in sshd_config, or on the
    commandline. This is the default, but some vendors enable the feature.
    <p>
    For more information see <a href="txt/x11fwd.adv">the advisory</a>.
    <br>
    This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 7.2p2 and in OpenBSD's stable branch.
    For more information, please
    refer to the <a href="txt/release-7.2p2">release notes</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>January 14, 2016</strong><br>
    OpenSSH clients between versions 5.4 and 7.1 are vulnerable to
    information disclosure that may allow a malicious server to retrieve
    information including under some circumstances, user's private keys.
    This may be mitigated by adding the undocumented config option
    <b>UseRoaming no</b> to ssh_config.<br>
    For more information see <a
    href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0777"
    >CVE-2016-0777</a> and <a
    href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-0778"
    >CVE-2016-0778</a>. <br>
    This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 7.1p2 and in OpenBSD's stable branch.
    For more information, please
    refer to the <a href="txt/release-7.1p2">release notes</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>August 21, 2015</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 7.0 contained a logic error in PermitRootLogin=
    prohibit-password/without-password that could, depending on
    compile-time configuration, permit password authentication to
    root while preventing other forms of authentication.<br>
    This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 7.1. For more information, please
    refer to the <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.1">release
    notes</a>
<p>

<li><strong>August 11, 2015</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 6.7 through 6.9 assign weak permissions to TTY devices.<br>
    Keyboard-interactive authentication in OpenSSH prior to 7.0 may
    allow circumvention of MaxAuthTries.<br>
    These bugs are corrected in OpenSSH 7.0. For more information, please
    refer to the <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.0">release
    notes</a>
<p>

<li><strong>June 30, 2015</strong><br>
    OpenSSH prior to 6.9 suffered from a race condition that could allow
    non-trusted X11 forwarding sessions to be treated as trusted.
    For more information, please
    refer to the <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-6.9">release
    notes</a>
<p>

<li><strong>November 8, 2013:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH versions 6.2 and 6.3 are vulnerable to the memory corruption
    problem described in the
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/gcmrekey.adv">gcmrekey.adv</a> advisory
    and the
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-6.4">OpenSSH 6.4 release notes</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>February 2, 2011:</strong><br>
    Portable OpenSSH prior to version 5.8p2 is vulnerable to the local
    host key theft attack described in 
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/portable-keysign-rand-helper.adv">portable-keysign-rand-helper.adv</a> advisory
    and the
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-5.8p2">OpenSSH 5.8p2 release notes</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>January 24, 2011:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH versions 5.6 and 5.7 are vulnerable to a potential leak of
    private key data described in the
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/legacy-cert.adv">legacy-cert.adv</a> advisory
    and the
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-5.8">OpenSSH 5.8 release notes</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>February 23, 2009:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH prior to version 5.2 is vulnerable to the protocol
     weakness described in 
    <a href="http://www.cpni.gov.uk/Docs/Vulnerability_Advisory_SSH.txt">CPNI-957037 "Plaintext Recovery Attack Against SSH"</a>.
    However, based on the limited information available it appears that this
    described attack is infeasible in most circumstances. For more
    information please refer to the
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/cbc.adv">cbc.adv</a> advisory
    and the
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-5.2">OpenSSH 5.2 release notes</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>July 22, 2008:</strong><br>
    Portable OpenSSH 5.1 and newer are not vulnerable to the X11UseLocalhost=no hijacking attack 
    on HP/UX (and possibly other systems) described in the
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-5.1">OpenSSH 5.1 release notes</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>April 3, 2008:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 5.0 and newer are not vulnerable to the X11 hijacking attack
    described in
    <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1483">CVE-2008-1483</a> and the
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-5.0">OpenSSH 5.0 release notes</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>March 31, 2008:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 4.9 and newer do not execute ~/.ssh/rc for sessions whose command
    has been overridden with a sshd_config(5) <em>ForceCommand</em> directive.
    This was a documented, but unsafe behaviour (described in
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-4.9">OpenSSH 4.9 release notes</a>).
<p>

<li><strong>September 5, 2007:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 4.7 and newer do not fall back to creating trusted X11
    authentication cookies when untrusted cookie generation fails (e.g. due to
    deliberate resource exhaustion), as described in the 
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-4.7">OpenSSH 4.7 release notes</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>November 7, 2006:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 4.5 and newer fix a weakness in the privilege separation monitor
    that could be used to spoof successful authentication (described in the 
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-4.5">OpenSSH 4.5 release notes</a>).
    Note that exploitation of this vulnerability would require an attacker to
    have already subverted the network-facing sshd(8) process, and no
    vulnerabilities permitting this are known.
<p>

<li><strong>September 27, 2006:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 4.4 and newer is not vulnerable to the unsafe signal handler
    vulnerability described in the 
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-4.4">OpenSSH 4.4 release notes</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>September 27, 2006:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 4.4 and newer is not vulnerable to the SSH protocol 1 denial of
    service attack described in the 
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-4.4">OpenSSH 4.4 release notes</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>February 1, 2006:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 4.3 and newer are not vulnerable to shell metacharacter expansion
    in scp(1) local-local and remote-remote copies 
    (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0225">CVE-2006-0225</a>), as described in the
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-4.3">OpenSSH 4.3 release notes</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>September 1, 2005:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 4.2 and newer does not allow delegation of GSSAPI credentials
    after authentication using a non-GSSAPI method as described in the
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-4.2">OpenSSH 4.2 release notes</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>September 1, 2005:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 4.2 and newer do not incorrectly activate GatewayPorts for
    dynamic forwardings (bug introduced in OpenSSH 4.0) as described in the
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-4.2">OpenSSH 4.2 release notes</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>September 16, 2003:</strong><br>
    Portable OpenSSH 3.7.1p2 and newer are not vulnerable to
    "September 23, 2003: Portable OpenSSH Multiple PAM vulnerabilities",
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/sshpam.adv">OpenSSH
    Security Advisory</a>. (This issue does not affect OpenBSD versions)
<p>

<li><strong>September 16, 2003:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 3.7.1 and newer are not vulnerable to
    "September 16, 2003: OpenSSH Buffer Management bug",
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/buffer.adv">OpenSSH
    Security Advisory</a> and CERT Advisory
    <a href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2003-24.html">CA-2003-24</a>.
<p>

<li><strong>June 26, 2002:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 3.4 and newer are not vulnerable to
    "June 26, 2002: OpenSSH Remote Challenge Vulnerability",
    <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/preauth.adv">OpenSSH
    Security Advisory</a>. 
<p>

<li><strong>March 29, 2002:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 3.2.1 and newer are not vulnerable to
    "April 21, 2002: Buffer overflow in AFS/Kerberos token passing code",
    <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/advisories/ssh_afstoken.txt">OpenSSH
    Security Advisory</a>: 
    Versions prior to OpenSSH 3.2.1 allow privileged access if
    AFS/Kerberos token passing is compiled in and enabled (either
    in the system or in sshd_config).
<p>

<li><strong>March 7, 2002:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 3.1 and newer are not vulnerable to
    "March 7, 2002: Off-by-one error in the channel code",
    <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/advisories/ssh_channelalloc.txt">OpenSSH
    Security Advisory</a>.  
<p>

<li><strong>November 24, 2001:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 3.0.2 and newer do not
    allow users to <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/157447">
    pass environment variables to login(1) if UseLogin is enabled</a>. 
    The UseLogin option is disabled by default in all OpenSSH releases.
<p>

<li><strong>May 21, 2001:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 2.9.9 and newer are not vulnerable to
    "Sep 26, 2001: Weakness in OpenSSH's source IP based access control
    for SSH protocol v2 public key authentication.",
    <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/advisories/ssh_option.txt">OpenSSH
    Security Advisory</a>.  
<p>

<li><strong>May 21, 2001:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 2.9.9 and newer do not
    allow users to <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/655259">
    delete files named "cookies" if X11 forwarding is enabled</a>. 
    X11 forwarding is disabled by default.
<p>

<li><strong>November 6, 2000:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 2.3.1, a development snapshot which was never released, was
    vulnerable to
    "Feb 8, 2001: Authentication By-Pass Vulnerability in OpenSSH-2.3.1",
    <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/advisories/ssh_bypass.txt">OpenBSD
    Security Advisory</a>.  
    In protocol 2, authentication could be bypassed if public key
    authentication was permitted. This problem does exist only
    in OpenSSH 2.3.1, a three week internal development release.
    OpenSSH 2.3.0 and versions newer than 2.3.1 are not vulnerable to
    this problem.
<p>

<li><strong>November 6, 2000:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 2.3.0 and newer do not allow
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/363181">
    malicious servers to access the client's X11 display or ssh-agent</a>.
    This problem has been fixed in OpenSSH 2.3.0.
<p>

<li><strong>November 6, 2000:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 2.3.0 and newer are not vulnerable to the
    "Feb 8, 2001: SSH-1 Daemon CRC32 Compensation Attack Detector Vulnerability",
    <a href="http://razor.bindview.com/publish/advisories/adv_ssh1crc.html">RAZOR Bindview Advisory CAN-2001-0144</a>.  
    A buffer overflow in the CRC32 compensation attack detector can
    lead to remote root access.  This problem has been fixed in
    OpenSSH 2.3.0.  However, versions prior to 2.3.0 are vulnerable.
<p>

<li><strong>September 2, 2000:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 2.2.0 and newer are not vulnerable to the
    "Feb 7, 2001: SSH-1 Session Key Recovery Vulnerability",
    CORE-SDI Advisory CORE-20010116.  OpenSSH imposes limits on the
    connection rate, making the attack unfeasible.  Additionally, the
    Bleichenbacher oracle has been closed completely since January 29,
    2001.
<p>

<li><strong>June 8, 2000:</strong><br>
    OpenSSH 2.1.1 and newer do not allow a remote attacker to
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/40327">
    execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of sshd if UseLogin</a>
    is enabled by the administrator. UseLogin is disabled by default.
    This problem has been fixed in OpenSSH 2.1.1.
<p>

<li>OpenSSH was never vulnerable to the
    "Feb 5, 2001: SSH-1 Brute Force Password Vulnerability",
    <a href="http://www.crimelabs.net/">Crimelabs Security Note CLABS200101</a>.
<p>

<li>OpenSSH was not vulnerable to the RC4 cipher
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/565052">password cracking</a>,
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/665372">replay</a>, or
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/25309">modification</a>
    attacks.  At the time that OpenSSH was started, it was already known
    that SSH 1 used the RC4 stream cipher completely incorrectly, and
    thus RC4 support was removed.
<p>

<li>OpenSSH was not vulnerable to
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/684820">client forwarding attacks</a>
    in unencrypted connections, since unencrypted connection support was
    removed at OpenSSH project start.
<p>

<li>OpenSSH was not vulnerable to IDEA-encryption algorithm
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/315308">attacks on the last packet</a>,
    since the IDEA algorithm is not supported.  The patent status of IDEA makes
    it unsuitable for inclusion in OpenSSH.
<p>

<li>OpenSSH does not treat localhost as exempt from host key checking,
    thus making it not vulnerable to the
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/786900">host key authentication bypass</a>
    attack.
<p>

<li>OpenSSH was not vulnerable to
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/118892">uncontrollable X11 forwarding</a>
    attacks because X11-forwarding is disabled by default and the user can
    de-permit it.
<p>

<li>OpenSSH has the SSH 1 protocol deficiency that might make an insertion attack
    difficult but possible.  The CORE-SDI
    <a href="http://www2.corest.com/common/showdoc.php?idx=131&amp;idxseccion=10">deattack mechanism</a>
    is used to eliminate
    the common case. SSH 1 protocol support is disabled by default.
</ul>
