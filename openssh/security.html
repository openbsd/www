<hr>

<p>
OpenSSH is developed with the same rigorous security process that the
OpenBSD group is famous for. If you wish to report a security issue in
OpenSSH, please contact the private developers list &lt;<a href="mailto:openssh@openssh.com">openssh@openssh.com</a>&gt;.

<p>
For more information, see the
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/security.html">OpenBSD security page</a>.

<li><p><b>July 1, 2024</b><br>
        sshd(8) in Portable OpenSSH versions 8.5p1 to 9.7p1 (inclusive).
    <br>
        Race condition resulting in potential remote code execution.
    <br>
        A race condition in sshd(8) could allow remote code execution as
	root on non-OpenBSD systems. This attack could be prevented by
	disabling the login grace timeout (<tt>LoginGraceTime=0</tt> in
	sshd_config) though this makes denial-of service against
	sshd(8) considerably easier.
    <br>
    For more information, please refer to the
    <a href="txt/release-9.8">release notes</a> and the report from the
    <a href="https://www.qualys.com/2024/07/01/cve-2024-6387/regresshion.txt">Qualys Security Advisory Team</a> who discovered the bug.

<li><p><b>July 1, 2024</b><br>
        ssh(1) in OpenSSH versions 9.5p1 to 9.7p1 (inclusive).
    <br>
        Logic error in ObscureKeystrokeTiming option. 
    <br>
        A logic error in the implementation of the ssh(1) ObscureKeystrokeTiming
	option rendered the feature ineffective and additionally exposed limited
	keystroke timing information when terminal echo was disabled, e.g. while
	entering passwords to su(8) or sudo(8). This condition could be avoided
	for affected versions by disabling the feature using
	<tt>ObscureKeystrokeTiming=no</tt>.
    <br>
    For more information, please refer to the
    <a href="txt/release-9.8">release notes</a>.

<li><p><b>December 18, 2023</b><br>
        ssh(1), sshd(8) in OpenSSH prior to version 9.6.
    <br>
        Weakness in initial key exchange ("Terrapin Attack")
    <br>
        A weakness in the initial SSH protocol key exchange allows an
	on-path attacker to delete a number of consecutive messages from
	the early encrypted protocol without detection. While cryptographically
	novel, there is no discernable impact on the integrity of SSH traffic
	beyond giving the attacker the ability to delete the message that
	enables some features related to keystroke timing obfuscation.
    <br>
	This attack is prevented by a new protocol extension in OpenSSH 9.6.
    <br>
    For more information, please refer to the
    <a href="txt/release-9.6">release notes</a>.

<li><p><b>December 18, 2023</b><br>
	ssh-agent(1) in OpenSSH between 8.9 and 9.5 (inclusive)
    <br>
	Incomplete application of destination constraints to smartcard keys.
    <br>
	Destination constraints added when loading PKCS#11 keys from a token
	were being applied to only the first key returned from the token.
    <br>
	This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.6.
    <br>
    For more information, please refer to the
    <a href="txt/release-9.6">release notes</a>.

<li><p><b>July 19, 2023</b><br>
        ssh-agent(1) in OpenSSH between and 5.5 and 9.3p1 (inclusive)
        remote code execution relating to PKCS#11 providers
    <br>
        The PKCS#11 support ssh-agent(1) could be abused to achieve remote
        code execution via a forwarded agent socket if the following conditions
        are met:
    <ul>
        <li>Exploitation requires the presence of specific libraries on the victim system.</li>
        <li>Remote exploitation requires that the agent was forwarded to an attacker-controlled system.</li>
    </ul>
        Exploitation can also be prevented by starting ssh-agent(1) with an
        empty PKCS#11/FIDO allowlist (ssh-agent -P '') or by configuring
        an allowlist that contains only specific provider libraries.
    <br>
        This vulnerability was discovered and demonstrated to be exploitable
        by the Qualys Security Advisory team. This vulnerability has been
        assigned CVE-2023-38408.
    <br>
	This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.3p2. For OpenBSD, an
        <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/errata.html">errata</a>
        patch exists to fix this problem.
    <br>
    For more information, please refer to the
    <a href="txt/release-9.3p2">release notes</a>.

<li><p><b>March 15, 2023</b><br>
    ssh-add(1) in OpenSSH between and 8.9 and 9.2 (inclusive).
    <br>
	ssh-add(1) did not apply destination constraints to smartcard keys.
    <br>
        When adding smartcard keys to ssh-agent(1) with the per-hop destination
	constraints (<em>ssh-add -h ...</em>), a logic error prevented the
	constraints from being communicated to the agent. This resulted in the
	keys being added without constraints. The common cases of
	non-smartcard keys and keys without destination constraints are
	unaffected. 
    <br>
	This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.3.
    <br>
    For more information, please refer to the
    <a href="txt/release-9.3">release notes</a>.

<li><p><b>February 2, 2023</b><br>
    ssh(1) in OpenSSH between and 8.7 and 9.1 (inclusive).
    <br>
	ssh(1) failed to correctly process PermitRemoteOpen options.
    <br>
        The PermitRemoteOpen option
        would ignore its first argument unless it was one of the special
        keywords "any" or "none", causing the permission list to fail open
        if only one permission was specified.
    <br>
	This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.2.
    <br>
    For more information, please refer to the
    <a href="txt/release-9.2">release notes</a>.

<li><p><b>February 2, 2023</b><br>
    ssh(1) in OpenSSH between and 6.5 and 9.1 (inclusive).
    <br>
	ssh(1) failed to check DNS names returned from libc for validity.
    <br>
        If the CanonicalizeHostname and CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs
        options were enabled, and the system/libc resolver did not check
        that names in DNS responses were valid, then use of these options
        could allow an attacker with control of DNS to include invalid
        characters (possibly including wildcards) in names added to
        known_hosts files when they were updated. These names would still
        have to match the CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs allow-list, so
        practical exploitation appears unlikely.
    <br>
	This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.2.
    <br>
    For more information, please refer to the
    <a href="txt/release-9.2">release notes</a>.

<li><p><b>February 2, 2023</b><br>
    sshd in OpenSSH between and 9.1 (only).
    <br>
	Double-free memory fault in pre-authentication sshd process.
    <br>
        sshd(8) contained a network-reachable pre-authentication double-free
        memory fault introduced in OpenSSH 9.1. This is not believed to be
        exploitable, and it occurs in the unprivileged pre-auth process that is
        subject to chroot(2) and is further sandboxed on most major
        platforms.
    <br>
	This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.2.
    <br>
    For more information, please refer to the
    <a href="txt/release-9.2">release notes</a>.

<li><p><b>September 26, 2021</b><br>
    sshd in OpenSSH between 6.2 and 8.7 (inclusive).
    <br>
	sshd(8) failed to correctly initialise supplemental groups when
	executing an <code>AuthorizedKeysCommand</code> or
	<code>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</code>, where a
	<code>AuthorizedKeysCommandUser</code> or
	<code>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser</code> directive was been set to
	run the command as a non-root user. Instead these commands would inherit
	the groups that sshd(8) was started with.
    <br>
	Depending on system configuration, inherited groups may allow
	the helper programs to gain unintended privilege.
    <br>
	Neither <code>AuthorizedKeysCommand</code> nor
	<code>AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand</code> are enabled by default in
	sshd_config(5).
    <br>
	This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 8.8
    <br>
    For more information, please refer to the
    <a href="txt/release-8.8">release notes</a>.

<li><p><b>March 3, 2021</b><br>
    ssh-agent in OpenSSH between 8.2 and 8.4 (inclusive).
    <br>
    Double-free memory corruption. Mitigated by socket peer user identity
    checking and double-free protection in malloc(3).
    This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 8.5
    For more information, please refer to the
    <a href="txt/release-8.5">release notes</a>.

<li><p><b>October 3, 2017</b><br>
    All version of OpenSSH prior to 7.6 supporting read-only mode in sftp-server
    (introduced in 5.5).
    Incorrect open(2) flags in sftp-server permitted creation
    of zero-length files when the server was running in read-only mode (invoked
    using the -R command-line flag).
    <br>
    This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 7.6.
    For more information, please refer to the
    <a href="txt/release-7.6">release notes</a>.

<li><p><b>March 9, 2016</b><br>
    All versions of OpenSSH prior to 7.2p2 with X11Forwarding
    enabled.
    Missing sanitisation of untrusted input allows an
    authenticated user who is able to request X11 forwarding
    to inject commands to xauth(1).
    <p>
    Mitigate by setting <b>X11Forwarding=no</b> in sshd_config, or on the
    commandline. This is the default, but some vendors enable the feature.
    <p>
    For more information see <a href="txt/x11fwd.adv">the advisory</a>.
    <br>
    This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 7.2p2 and in OpenBSD's stable branch.

    refer to the <a href="txt/release-7.2p2">release notes</a>.

<li><p><b>January 14, 2016</b><br>
    OpenSSH clients between versions 5.4 and 7.1 are vulnerable to
    information disclosure that may allow a malicious server to retrieve
    information including under some circumstances, user's private keys.
    This may be mitigated by adding the undocumented config option

    "Feb 5, 2001: SSH-1 Brute Force Password Vulnerability",
    <a href="http://www.crimelabs.net/">Crimelabs Security Note CLABS200101</a>.

<li><p>OpenSSH was not vulnerable to the RC4 cipher
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/565052">password cracking</a>,
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/665372">replay</a>, or
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/25309">modification</a>
    attacks.  At the time that OpenSSH was started, it was already known
    that SSH 1 used the RC4 stream cipher completely incorrectly, and
    thus RC4 support was removed.

<li><p>OpenSSH was not vulnerable to
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/684820">client forwarding attacks</a>
    in unencrypted connections, since unencrypted connection support was
    removed at OpenSSH project start.

<li><p>OpenSSH was not vulnerable to IDEA-encryption algorithm
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/315308">attacks on the last packet</a>,
    since the IDEA algorithm is not supported.  The patent status of IDEA makes
    it unsuitable for inclusion in OpenSSH.

<li><p>OpenSSH does not treat localhost as exempt from host key checking,
    thus making it not vulnerable to the
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/786900">host key authentication bypass</a>
    attack.

<li><p>OpenSSH was not vulnerable to
    <a href="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/118892">uncontrollable X11 forwarding</a>
    attacks because X11-forwarding is disabled by default and the user can
    de-permit it.

<li><p>OpenSSH has the SSH 1 protocol deficiency that might make an insertion attack
    difficult but possible.  The CORE-SDI
    <a href="http://www2.corest.com/common/showdoc.php?idx=131&amp;idxseccion=10">deattack mechanism</a>
    is used to eliminate
    the common case. SSH 1 protocol support is disabled by default.
