<hr>

The following "free" clients are recommended for interoperating with
OpenSSH from Java clients:<p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.isnetworks.com/ssh/">MindTerm 1</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation. GPL Licence.
<p>

"MindTerm is an entirely FREE(*) SSH protocol 1 client program
written in 100% pure Java (non-certified). It is distributed with
source code since we believe that security related software can't
otherwise be seriously trusted. MindTerm can be run as a stand-alone
program or as an applet in a webpage. It can be run with or without a
GUI (stand-alone). It has two notable features setting it apart from
some other clients, built in scp file transfer and a special
ftp-tunnel which works with "ordinary" ftpd's "behind" the sshd."<p>
NOTE: Mindterm 2 is not free.
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.mud.de/se/jta/doc/plugins/SSH.html">SSH Plugin</a>
is an SSH1-only implementation, by Matthias L. Jugel and Marcus Mei&szlig;ner.
GPL Licence.<p>

"This implementation of SSH provides IDEA and RSA/PKCS#1 encryption and
was originally written in 1998 by C&eacute;dric Gourio. He used a part of the
old Java Telnet Applet to write his Java SSH client and so the code
was similar to our old applet."
<p>

<li><a href="http://www.ganymed.ethz.ch/ssh2">Ganymed-SSH2</a>.
BSD style license.<p>

"The Ganymed-SSH2 for Java library (implementing the SSH-2 protocol)
is used in Ganymed and a couple of other projects at ETH Zurich.
It allows you to connect to SSH servers from within your Java programs."
<p>

</ul>
