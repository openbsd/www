<hr>

<h3><font color="#0000e0">Released versions problem reports.</font></h3>

Before reporting bugs/problems with released OpenSSH versions,
go through this checklist:
<ol>
<li>First check for <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/errata.html">patches
	and notes regarding OpenSSH.</a>
<li>Next find out if there is a newer version available for
<a href="openbsd.html">OpenBSD</a>
or for the <a href="portable.html">portable release</a>,
depending upon your platform.
</ol>
<p>

If nothing looks like it addresses your problem, then use
<a href="http://bugzilla.mindrot.org">Bugzilla</a>
to submit a bug report.
<p>

You can reach the OpenSSH developers directly by sending email to
<a href="mailto:openssh@openssh.com">openssh@openssh.com</a>. If 
your problem relates to the portable version of OpenSSH and is not
security related, please use the 
<a href="mailto:openssh-unix-dev@mindrot.org">openssh-unix-dev@mindrot.org</a> 
mailing list instead. This list is open to posting from non-subscribed users.

<h3><font color="#0000e0">Current version problem reports.</font></h3>

<ol>
<li>Test the problem at least twice, with source updated a few days apart.
<li>Do not report source tree compilation problems, unless they persist.
	They are almost always your mistake or they are being worked on
	as you encounter them. 
<li>Remember that the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html">anoncvs</a>
	servers are updated significantly behind the actual working source tree.
<li>Check for <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/plus.html">OpenSSH changes</a>
        to see if the problem has been addressed.
</ol>

<h3><font color="#0000e0">Sending in bug reports.</font></h3>

Try to pin-point the exact problem.  Never give vague instructions,
or detail vague problems like "it crashes."
Talk to others on IRC or use some
other forum such as the <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=openssh-unix-dev&amp;r=1&amp;w=2">
mailing list archives</a>
to confirm that it is new, repeatable, etc., and make sure
it is not a local problem.  
<p>

New features are accepted, especially with code that implements
your suggested new feature.
If someone else writes code for your new feature, the chances are that
it will be misunderstood and created so that you will not recognize it.
<p>

Types of bug reports in order of desirability:
<ol>
<li>Repeatable problems with source fixes are the best.
<li>Repeatable problems that are not specific to your hardware/software
     layout.
<li>Repeatable problems specific to your software layout.
<li>Repeatable problems specific to your hardware layout.
</ol>
