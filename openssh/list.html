Mailing Lists

<hr>

<h2>Developers private list</h2>

Security-related issues may be sent to the private list <a
href="mailto:openssh@openssh.com">openssh@openssh.com</a> which is
read only by the OpenSSH developers.  It is not appropriate for general
enquiries, see below for more appropriate places for those.

<p>

<p>

<h2>Announcement list</h2>
<p>
The Linux/Unix port of OpenSSH has a read-only mailing list
<a href="mailto:openssh-unix-announce@mindrot.org">
openssh-unix-announce@mindrot.org</a>.
This list carries announcements of updated versions and related software.
This list is closed for public posting and is very low-volume.
<p>
Information on subscription and list account management may be found
<a href="https://lists.mindrot.org/mailman/listinfo/openssh-unix-announce"
> here</a>.

<h2>Developers public list</h2>
<p>

The <a href="https://lists.mindrot.org/mailman/listinfo/openssh-unix-dev"
>openssh-unix-dev</a> list (<a href="mailto:openssh-unix-dev@mindrot.org"
>openssh-unix-dev@mindrot.org</a>) is for the discussions relating to
the development of both the portable and OpenBSD version of OpenSSH.

<p>

Traffic is light to moderate (zero to twenty messages per day). Valid
subjects are the development of OpenSSH (both portable and OpenBSD
versions), documentation and troubleshooting (assuming you have read
the manual). HTML, "rich text" formatted email and large attachments are
<b>NOT PERMITTED</b>.  Posting requests for help which demonstrate your
lack of familiarity with the basic documentation is likely to result in
only "RTFM" responses, so please check it first.

<p>

Discussion of commercial products is <b>*off topic*</b> for this mailing
list, except when it arises in the context of OpenSSH development
(e.g. discussing interoperability).

<p>

The list is open to non-subscribers although they may be subject to
a one-time address validation.  Small attachments (such as diff files)
are acceptable within the bounds of common sense. The list is <a
href="https://marc.info/?l=openssh-unix-dev&amp;r=1&amp;w=2">archived
by MARC</a>.  <p>

More information on subscription and list account management may be found
at the <a href="https://lists.mindrot.org/mailman/listinfo/openssh-unix-dev"
>openssh-unix-dev@mindrot.org information page</a>.  <p>


<h2>Newsgroup</h2>
<p>
General support (especially regarding interoperability issues)
may also be found at the newsgroup
<a href="news:comp.security.ssh">comp.security.ssh</a>.
<p>


<h2>General SSH user discussion list</h2>
<p>
The archive of the former secureshell@securityfocus.com list at
<a href="https://marc.info/?l=secure-shell&amp;r=1&amp;w=2">
MARC</a> may provide additional historical information.
