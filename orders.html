    Every six months (around May 1 and Nov 1) OpenBSD makes an official software release.
    To accompany this free software release on the FTP servers, we make
    <a href="lyrics.html">artwork and a song</a>
    which are distributed along with the software on a set of CDs.  The proceeds
    from sale of these products is the primary funding of the OpenBSD project.
    <p>
    We have a close relationship with our primary distributor
    <a href=#ca/cshop>the Computer Shop of Calgary</a>
    who also sells our product worldwide direct to customers via post or courier.
    <p>
    Worldwide orders for the new (and <a href="older.html">older</a>)
    products can be made from
    <a href="https://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order">
    the Computer Shop of Calgary order site</a>.

<hr>

Our products are also available at many stores around the world.
Typically, these stores will have the current release
and accept pre-orders for the next release, but their stock of
<a href="older.html">older releases</a> will vary greatly.
The OpenBSD project does not keep track of which store
has which releases or items in stock.  If you see a store on this list
which is not stocking either the current or next release, or has other
problems, please inform <a href=mailto:deraadt@openbsd.org>deraadt@openbsd.org</a>
so that other customers won't run into the same difficulties.

This store is the main distributor and vendor of OpenBSD products.
The town of Milk River is located in southern Alberta minutes from
the US border, and thus packages are shipped from the more convenient
side of the US / Canada border (out of the town of Sweet Grass).
Purchases can be made in the following ways:
<p> 

  <ul>
  <li><font color="#e00000">Secure web purchase:</font>
    <a href="https://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order">International Order Site</a><br>
    Note that credit cards are debited in Canadian dollars, so expect
    very slight fluctuations.  The order site permits specifying
    alternative payment methods but since shipping costs depend on
    many factors either ask for a shipping quote in advance, or
    estimate the costs.
    <p>

    To Canada first add the GST/HST, then for US or Canada add 10% for
    shipping.  For other countries add 20%, except that for T-shirts or
    books, which are fairly heavy, shipping costs for our standard AIRMAIL
    shipping may be 30% or more -- consider accepting the 60 days transit
    time for "slow boat" surface shipping, and then 20% will still work --
    but request surface shipping explicitly in the comments if you do this. 
    If the result is reasonably close, we will just accept it, or if wildly
    different we will either include a refund, or else we will request a bit
    more which can be paid later, but we won't delay shipping.
    <p>
	<ul>
	<li>PayPal<br>
	Payments may be sent to <strong>cshop@computershop.ca</strong>.
	Just place a web order, select payment method "pre-arranged",
	and put a note in the comments section of the order that payment
	is being made by PayPal. Pay in either US dollars, Canadian
	dollars or Euros.
	<p>

	<li>Bank Wire Transfer<br>
	Wire transfers of Euro (equivalent) amounts within the Euro zone
	are very inexpensive or free.  Just convert at the current market
	rate from CDN$ to calculate amount.  For purchases from the Euro
	zone this is much easier than PayPal, and saves us the additional
	PayPal fees.  <a href="http://www.computershop.ca/transfer.html">
	Detailed bank-to-bank transfer instructions.</a>
	<p>

	Cost of bank wires outside the Euro zone are usually about $25 US
	or $25 Canadian, depending on destination bank and origin bank.
	We have to add these to the cost of the order, plus, there are
	costs at the sending end.
	</ul>
    <p>

    <li><font color="#e00000">Telephone ordering:</font><br>

    Please phone during weekdays, during the daytime, in North American
    Mountain Time. (Occasionally service is available after hours: 5PM-9PM
    weeknights and 10AM-9PM weekends.  You can give it a try.) Have
    Mastercard, VISA, or American Express ready.<br>

    Major Institutions can use purchase orders and we will bill later.

    <li><font color="#e00000">Mail order:</font><br>
    Cost, including ordinary postage, for just one CD set, version 4.x, is:

Postage will vary depending on your location relative to the shipping
address.  Special instructions should be specified in the comments of the
order.  By default we ship as follows: Shipments of single CD sets to USA,
Canada, or any other country will be sent by FIRST CLASS (Air)mail.
<p>

Tracking number notification and insurance cost for single CD's sent to the
USA is free and included in the original cost of postage.
<p>

For Canada FIRST CLASS insurance is $5 CDN.  This insurance may be paid
either at time of order (you must so specify in the comment section of the
order), or, at the rate of $6 CDN, it may be paid after it is found that the
item has gone missing, and upon requesting the replacement.  Unfortunately,
unlike the USA, there is no tracking number service available for FIRST
CLASS packets in Canada.  For tracking number notification in Canada, one
must go to a more expensive class of mail called Express Post.
<p>

To Canada packages larger than 1 CD set are sent via Expedited Parcel by
default.  Tracking number notification is included in the postage cost.
Insurance is included at the cost of $1.20 CDN / $100 CDN.  If you specify
not to insure, in the comments section of the order, we only cover 1/2 the
cost of the package, and you have to pick up the other 1/2, if something
goes missing in the mail.  Express post, if specified explicitly, includes
insurance up to $100 CDN.
<p>

To the USA, packages larger than 1 CD set, not including T-shirts, are sent
by media mail from Sweet Grass, Montana.  Such shipments include tracking
number notification.  We include a bit extra shipping cost so we ourselves
can cover loss or damage to the goods in the mail, given that regular mail
insurance is not available for this class of mail.  We ask you to pay only
the re-shipment shipping cost in such cases.
<p>

Still, to the USA, where there are T-shirts in the package, due to overly
complex customs documentation (complain to the lobbyists for the garment
makers unions), packages containing T-shirts have to be sent by mail from
Canada.  Less than 1 kg (2.2 lbs) they are sent by "small packet" AIRMAIL.
There is no tracking on this service, but there is up to $100 CDN
insurance included in the price of postage (which varies by weight and
destination state).  Additional insurance for "small packet" is not
available.  For packages weighing more than 1 kg, by default we use
"Expedited Parcel", tracking number notification is included, and we include
insurance in the cost of the shipping, unless told not to.  For any
insurance shortfall, we only cover 1/2 the cost, and you have to cover the
other 1/2.  If in doubt, (as the above is fairly complex to understand),
specify "FULL INSURANCE" in the comment section of the order. In that case,
we will find a fully insured way to ship.
<p>

To the USA, Canada and certain other countries, Express Post service (which
becomes Priority Post once in the USA) is always available.  If we use
Express Post (US Priority Post), where we
can ship from within the USA (no T-shirts), then we will always insure for
full value, and include the cost in the original postage, unless told
not to.  In the latter case we only cover 1/2 of any loss.  There is special
option for Express Post for USA or Canadian orders on the web order form.
You only have to select it.  We may soon turn that on for other countries,
but will use our best shipping judgement (registered parcel with insurance)
where Express Post is not available.  Countries with unreliable postal
administration, Mexico, for example, are not eligible for insurance for any
class of parcel except "small packet".  We may break the order into chunks
of less than 2 kg if necessary to get insurance.  Small packets to non-USA
countries may be up to 2 kg.
<p>

In USA/Canada less than 1% of items go missing in the mail; however, who
knows, it might be yours.  But if you absolutely can't stand risk, do by all
means specify FULL INSURANCE in the comments area of the order form on the
web.  We will then make sure we ship in a fully insured way, and add any
necessary costs to the postage.
<p>

Packages will generally be mailed either from Milk River, Alberta,
Canada, or Sweet Grass, Montana. Typical AIRMAIL postage rates
for quantity one, of just the CD set, are roughly:
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>Canada $3 CDN.  Expect 7 days. (Letter Class)
    <li>USA $4 CDN.  Expect 7 days. (First Class)
    <li>World $9 CDN.  Expect two weeks. (Small Packet)
    </ul>
<p>

For other items or combination shipments, the shipping costs are too complex 
to show here, but trust us, we keep shipping costs down as much as possible.
If it's a major concern, email us.

Note:  Transit time estimates do not take into account the fact that
shipping backlogs during the first month after a new release may require an
extra one to two weeks before the package hits the mail.  During the rest
of the year turn-around is typically a few days.<p>

Typical cost for Express Post (becomes Priority Post in the USA) for a
single CD set:
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>Canada $11 CDN.  Expect 2 - 3 days.
    <li>USA $17 CDN. Expect 4 - 6 days.
    <li>World $48 CDN. Expect 5-8 days.  Not available to every country.
    </ul>
<p>

To have the CD to come very quickly, choose a courier or similar service
provided from the post office.
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>For Canada we recommend Purolator.
    <li>For the USA we recommend US postal "EXPRESS MAIL" service, or
    secondly UPS.  This usually excludes shipping T-shirts however,
    since they are effectively blocked at the border by excessive customs
    paperwork requirements.
    <li>For international we recommend DHL.  FEDEX is no longer available
    except for non T-shirt orders, and never to Canada, as they do not serve
    Milk River, Alberta, our Canadian shipping location. 
    </ul>
<p>

For courier service or equivalent 1 to 2 day service from the post office,
you very likely <b>do NOT</b> want to use the Internet web ordering system,
but rather want to order by phoning the Computer Shop.  If phoning before 11
AM Mountain Time, you can often have it by early the next morning! See phone
ordering (above).<p>

If ordering the CD plus other items, consider having only the CD
sent by courier and other things by regular airmail or express post.  CDs
are relatively inexpensive to send by courier (we class them as documents),
whereas T-shirts, and especially posters, are quite expensive that way.
Sometimes, particularly for posters, we will guess that this is what is
wanted.  Say in the comments if you really want all items, even posters,
sent by courier.
<p>

For Canada, and USA only, one may specify "use credit card" in the box
where it says <i>courier account number</i>.  In that case we will pass on
the credit card number to the courier company.  There will be a separate
debit from them (for the shipping portion only).  But we prefer if you do
have a courier account number already. If requesting shipping to a company
address, ask if they have one that can be used (or phone DHL or UPS, for
example, and ask what it is).
<p>

UPS, Purolator, DHL, or Postal courier shipping rates for quantity 1
are roughly:
<p>
    <ul>
    <li>Canada $20 CDN.  Sometimes overnight if phoned in before 2 PM MST.
    <li>USA $20 USD -- Overnight (to some cities) if phoned in before
    11 AM MST.  May depend if we are making a border run that day.  
    <li>World $55 USD -- 2 to 4 day service.  Must have courier
    account #. If necessary, apply for one or, otherwise, use insured
    AIR MAIL post for the closest equivalent.  Express post, trackable
    and insured, is available for some countries, a bit less expensive
    and almost as good.
    </ul>
<p>

<b>Partial shipments:</b> Sometimes a T-shirt of a certain size might not be

OpenBSD production is done by 
<a href=#ca/cshop>the Computer Shop of Calgary</a>, 
which is located in the town of Milk River, Alberta, near the Montana
border, so mail-order direct into the US is pretty fast (except for textiles
which take a bit longer due to customs paperwork requirements). <p>

<p>
You can also contact your favorite book seller and give them the current
ISBN number, and ask them to special order for you.  In fact this is a
good way to help increase channels of distribution for OpenBSD, since
if they get a number of orders, it may encourage them to stock it
regularly in the future.
