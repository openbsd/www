<strong>003: RELIABILITY FIX: January 13, 2006</strong>
&nbsp; <i>i386 architecture</i><br>
Change the implementation of i386 W^X so that the "execute line" can move around.
Before it was limited to being either at 512MB (below which all code normally
lands) or at the top of the stack. Now the line can float as
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mprotect.2">mprotect(2)</a>
and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/mmap.2">mmap(2)</a>
requests need it to. This is now implemented using only GDT selectors
instead of the LDT so that it is more robust as well.

<li id="ssh">
<strong>005: SECURITY FIX: February 12, 2006</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
Josh Bressers has reported a weakness in OpenSSH caused due to the insecure use of the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/system.3">system(3)</a>
function in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/scp.1">scp(1)</a>

<li id="sendmail">
<strong>006: SECURITY FIX: March 25, 2006</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
A race condition has been reported to exist in the handling by sendmail of
asynchronous signals. A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running sendmail, typically root.

<strong>007: SECURITY FIX: May 2, 2006</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
A security vulnerability has been found in the X.Org server --
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1526">CVE-2006-1526</a>.

<li id="sendmail2">
<strong>008: SECURITY FIX: June 15, 2006</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A malformed MIME
message could trigger excessive recursion which will lead to stack exhaustion.
This denial of service attack only affects delivery of mail from the queue and
delivery of a malformed message. Other incoming mail is still accepted and
delivered. However, mail messages in the queue may not be reattempted if a
malformed MIME message exists.

&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a>'s
mod_rewrite has a potentially exploitable off-by-one buffer overflow.
The buffer overflow may result in a vulnerability which, in combination
with certain types of Rewrite rules in the web server configuration files,
could be triggered remotely. The default install is not affected by the
buffer overflow. CVE-2006-3747

<strong>010: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006</strong>

with really long header lines could trigger a use-after-free bug causing
sendmail to crash.

<strong>011: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
Due to an off-by-one error in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/dhcpd.8">dhcpd(8)</a>,
it is possible to cause
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/dhcpd.8">dhcpd(8)</a>

<li id="isakmpd">
<strong>013: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
A problem in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/isakmpd.8">isakmpd(8)</a>
caused IPsec to run partly without replay protection. If
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/isakmpd.8">isakmpd(8)</a>
was acting as responder during SA negotiation, SA's with a replay window of size 0 were created.
An attacker could reinject sniffed IPsec packets, which will be accepted without checking the
replay counter.

<strong>014: SECURITY FIX: September 2, 2006</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>

it is possible for an attacker to send LCP packets via an
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/sppp.4">sppp(4)</a>
connection causing the kernel to panic.

<li id="bind">
<strong>015: SECURITY FIX: September 8, 2006</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
Two Denial of Service issues have been found with BIND.
An attacker who can perform recursive lookups on a DNS server and is able
to send a sufficiently large number of recursive queries, or is able to
get the DNS server to return more than one SIG(covered) RRsets can stop
the functionality of the DNS service.
An attacker querying an authoritative DNS server serving a RFC 2535
DNSSEC zone may be able to crash the DNS server.

<strong>016: SECURITY FIX: September 8, 2006</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
Due to incorrect PKCS#1 v1.5 padding validation in OpenSSL, it is possible for
an attacker to construct an invalid signature which OpenSSL would accept as a
valid PKCS#1 v1.5 signature.

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.8/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a>
does not sanitize the Expect header from an HTTP request when it is
reflected back in an error message, which might allow cross-site scripting (XSS)

<li id="openssl2">
<strong>018: SECURITY FIX: October 7, 2006</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
Several problems have been found in OpenSSL. While parsing certain invalid ASN.1
structures an error condition is mishandled, possibly resulting in an infinite
loop. A buffer overflow exists in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers function. A NULL
pointer may be dereferenced in the SSL version 2 client code. In addition, many
applications using OpenSSL do not perform any validation of the lengths of
public keys being used.
