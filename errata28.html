<li id="pcibios">
<strong>006: STABILITY FIX: Dec 4, 2000</strong><br>
On some machines, a PCIBIOS device driver interrupt allocation bug can cause a
kernel hang while probing PCI devices.  If you have this symptom, you can disable
PCIBIOS as a workaround.  To do this,
    <ul>
    <li>Enter the User Kernel Configuration by booting with the
	option &quot;boot -c&quot;.
    <li>Once at the <i>UKC></i> prompt, enter
        <blockquote><pre>
	UKC> disable pcibios
	UKC> quit<!--
	--></pre></blockquote>
    <li>See <a href="./faq/faq5.html#5.6">this page</a> after a successful
    boot for instructions on how to re-write your kernel to disable PCIBIOS
    permanently.
    </ul>

<li id="x_sun3">
<strong>007: INSTALL PROBLEM: Dec 4, 2000</strong><br>
The X packages
<a href="https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/sun3/xshare28.tgz">share28.tgz</a>
and
<a href="https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/sun3/xfont28.tgz">font28.tgz</a>
were not on the CD, and only available via FTP install.  These packages can be
added post-install by using the following command:
<pre>
    # cd /; tar xvfpz xshare28.tgz
    # cd /; tar xvfpz xfont28.tgz
</pre>
<p>

<li id="kerberos">
<strong>008: SECURITY FIX: Dec 7, 2000</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
Two problems have recently been discovered in the KerberosIV code.<p>
1. A symlink problem was discovered in the KerberosIV password checking
routines /usr/bin/su and /usr/bin/login, which makes it possible for a
local user to overwrite any file on the local machine.<p>
2. It is possible to specify environment variables in telnet
which will be passed over the to the remote host. This makes it
possible to set environment variables on the remote side, including
ones that have special meaning on the server. It is not clear at this
time what the impact is, but we recommend everyone to upgrade their
machines immediately.<p>

<li id="readline">
<strong>024: SECURITY FIX: Mar 18, 2001</strong>

The readline library shipped with OpenBSD allows history files creation
with a permissive
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.8/umask.2">umask(2)</a>.
This can lead to the leakage of sensitive information in applications
that use passwords and the like during user interaction (one such

<li id="sendmail">
<strong>028: SECURITY FIX: May 29, 2001</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
The signal handlers in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.8/sendmail.8">sendmail(8)</a> contain code that is unsafe in the
context of a signal handler.  This leads to potentially serious
race conditions.  At the moment this is a theoretical attack only
and can only be exploited on the local host (if at all).<br>

<li id="fts">
<strong>029: SECURITY FIX: May 30, 2001</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
Programs using the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.8/fts.3">fts(3)</a>
routines (such as rm, find, and most programs that take a <b>-R</b>
flag) can be tricked into changing into the wrong directory if the
parent dir is changed out from underneath it.  This is similar to
the old fts bug but happens when popping out of directories, as
opposed to descending into them.

<strong>030: SECURITY FIX: June 15, 2001</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
A race condition exists in the kernel <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.8/execve.2">execve(2)</a> implementation that opens a small window of vulnerability for a non-privileged user to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.8/ptrace.2">ptrace(2)</a> attach to a suid/sgid process.

<strong>031: SECURITY FIX: August 21, 2001</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
A security hole exists in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.8/sendmail.8">sendmail(8)</a>

&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
A security hole exists in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.8/lpd.8">lpd(8)</a>
that may allow an attacker with line printer access to gain root
privileges.  A machine must be running lpd to be vulnerable (OpenBSD
does not start lpd by default).  Only machines with line printer
access (ie: listed in either /etc/hosts.lpd or /etc/hosts.equiv)
may be used to mount an attack.

<strong>033: SECURITY FIX: September 11, 2001</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
A security hole exists in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.8/uuxqt.8">uuxqt(8)</a>
that may allow an attacker to run arbitrary commands as user uucp and
use this to gain root access.
The UUCP execution daemon, uuxqt(8), has a bug in its command line
parsing routine may allow arbitrary commands to be run.  Because
some UUCP commands are run as root (and daemon) from cron it is possible
to leverage compromise of the UUCP user to gain root.
