Portable Release
</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Normal OpenSSH development produces a very small, secure, and easy to
maintain version for the OpenBSD project.
<a href="history.html#portable">The OpenSSH Portability Team</a>
takes that pure version and adds portability code so that OpenSSH can
run on many other operating systems. (Unfortunately, in particular
since OpenSSH does authentication, it runs into a <strong>*lot*</strong>
of differences between Unix operating systems.)

<p>
The OpenSSH provided here is designed to run on the following Unix
operating systems:

<ul>
<li>AIX
<li>HP-UX
<li>Irix
<li>Linux
<li>NeXT
<li>SCO
<li>SNI/Reliant Unix
<li>Solaris
<li>Digital Unix/Tru64/OSF
<li>macOS
<li>Cygwin
<li>... and more are being added all the time.
</ul>

<p>
The portable OpenSSH follows development of the official version, but
releases are not synchronized. Portable releases are marked with a 'p'
(e.g. 4.0p1). The official OpenBSD source will never use the 'p' suffix,
but will instead increment the version number when it hits 'stable
spots' in development.

The following files describe the development efforts of the OpenSSH
portability development team. The release files are signed with the PGP
public key contained in the file <a
href="https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/RELEASE_KEY.asc"
>RELEASE_KEY.asc</a> on the ftp site. This key is also available through the
<a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/">key server network</a> and has a fingerprint
of 7168B983815A5EEF59A4ADFD2A3F414E736060BA.

<h2 id="reportbug">Reporting bugs</h2>
<p>
Bugs in OpenSSH Portable can be reported via the channels described in
<a href="report.html">Problem reports</a>.
Note that many operating system vendors modify the OpenSSH that they
ship; in those cases you should report problems to those vendors,
unless the problem can also be reproduced with an unmodified OpenSSH.

<h2 id="cvs"><span id="git"></span>Developers</h2>
<p>
Bleeding-edge nightly snapshots are available
<a href="https://www.mindrot.org/openssh_snap/">here</a>.
Portable OpenSSH's source tree is also available by git:

<ul>
<li><code>git://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git</code> (clone only)
<li><code>https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git</code> (web and clone)
</ul>

This repository is provided and maintained
by <a href="mailto:djm@openbsd.org">Damien Miller</a>. It is also mirrored at
<a href="https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable">GitHub</a>.

<h2 id="building">Building</h2>
<p>
Once checked out, the <code>configure</code> file needs to be created by
running <code>autoreconf</code> from the <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/"> autoconf</a> package
(the required version is listed in the INSTALL file).  It will also need to
be run again if any changes are made to the <code>configure.ac</code> file.

<p>
Developers are asked to read and follow
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/style">these guidelines</a>
when submitting code. Patches should be sent in unified diff format.
