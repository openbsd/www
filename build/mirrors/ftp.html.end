The file structure of each server is:

<ul>
<li><b>/pub/OpenBSD/</b><br>
	Absolute path for mirrors where the OpenBSD FTP collection
	<strong>must</strong> be available. This location can be a link,
	if necessary.
	<p>
<li><b>/pub/OpenBSD/7.7/</b><br>
	Where you find our most recent release.
  <ul>
  <!-- XXXrelease - make sure platform list is current -->
  <li><b>alpha/</b>
  <li><b>amd64/</b>
  <li><b>arm64/</b>
  <li><b>armv7/</b>
  <li><b>hppa/</b>

  <li><b>loongson/</b>
  <li><b>luna88k/</b>
  <li><b>macppc/</b>
  <li><b>octeon/</b>
  <li><b>packages/</b><br>
	Binary packages (pre-compiled ports) to install on your release
	or -stable system.
  <li><b>powerpc64/</b>
  <li><b>riscv64/</b>
  <li><b>sparc64/</b>
  <li><b>src.tar.gz</b><br>
	Userland sources, to be placed in <code>/usr/src</code>.
  <li><b>sys.tar.gz</b><br>
	Kernel sources, to be placed in <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.

	The ports tree, to be placed in <code>/usr/ports</code>.
  <li><b>xenocara.tar.gz</b><br>
	X window system sources, to be placed in <code>/usr/xenocara</code>.
  </ul>
<p>
<li><b>/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/</b><br>
	For our major architectures, we frequently build releases

	This is where we place those test releases.
<p>
<li><b>/pub/OpenBSD/tools/</b><br>

<h3 id="prospective">Information for Prospective Mirrors</h3>

<p>
To be listed on this page we require mirrors to be fast, up to date,
capable, and well-connected to networks in the region in which they serve.

<p>
Mirrors must carry the following:

<ul>
  <li>OS and packages for <strong>all architectures</strong>
  <li>at least the <strong>last two releases</strong> in binary form
  <li><strong>up-to-date snapshots</strong> (no older than a week)
  <li><strong>all associated directories</strong>
    <br>(including OpenSSH/, OpenNTPD/, OpenBGPD/, OpenIKED/, LibreSSL/,
         patches/, rpki-client/, syspatch/ and tools/)
</ul>

Also:

<ul>
  <li>http/ftp must use the directory structure shown above, with files under <strong>/pub/OpenBSD</strong>
  <li>use a second-level mirror as upstream - no chains of mirrors
</ul>

<p>
As of March 2020, the minimum space required is approximately 750GB.
However, to reduce problems for users when snapshot packages are updated, it is
strongly recommended to use the rsync options <kbd>--delete-delay --delay-updates</kbd>
which require additional space during updates.
<kbd>--fuzzy</kbd> may also be helpful to reduce the amount of data transferred
when updating snapshot packages.
Depending on the disk space available, mirrors may provide more contents,
such as older releases, current source tree, etc.

<p>
A suggested <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.conf">httpd.conf(5)</a>
configuration for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd">httpd(8)</a>
that is suitable for being www and ftp space mirror is <a href="httpd.conf">here</a>.

<p>
Operators of mirrors who are interested in having their site added to
the list on this page should make sure they meet the above requirements,
including directory paths, and then contact <a
href="mailto:mirrors-discuss@openbsd.org">mirrors-discuss@openbsd.org</a>
with further details about their site, including network connectivity,
geographic location, and general information.
Include details of where you currently mirror from and how often.
If that is not already a second-level mirror, we will suggest one to
switch to.
<strong>Do not</strong> mirror from ftp.openbsd.org.

<p>
Mirror operators should subscribe to the low-volume
<a href="https://lists.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&extra=mirrors-announce">mirrors-announce</a>
mailing list.
