OpenBSD/sparc runs on most of the 32bit Sun SPARC workstations, including
the sun4, sun4c, sun4e and sun4m architecture families
(but not the 64bit UltraSPARC computers, which are supported by
<a href="sparc64.html">OpenBSD/sparc64</a>).

<p>
<strong>The OpenBSD/sparc port was discontinued after the 5.9 release.</strong>

<p>
A mailing list dedicated to the OpenBSD/sparc and OpenBSD/sparc64 ports is

<h3 id="history"><strong>History:</strong></h3>

<p>
The original 4.4BSD port was done by Chris Torek as a contract to
LBL. The code was released by Chris in mid-1993, and Theo de Raadt
worked it into shape for the NetBSD tree.  Theo and Markus Wild worked
on improving Chris' original SunOS compatibility code into a highly
complete and reliable emulation. Chuck Cranor ported the sun4c code to
the 8KB pagesize sun4 architecture, and Theo merged this code in a
way that would allow the same kernel and programs to run on either
sun4c or sun4 machines (unlike Sun's separate kernel environments).
This last change also required a rewrite of the device configuration
code.  Just after the NetBSD/sparc 1.0 release, Peter Galbavy wrote an
ESP SCSI device driver as a replacement for Chris' sparc-specific SCSI
code.

<p>
At this point a conflict emerged between Theo and the other people he
started the NetBSD project with, and Theo was forced by the core group
to resign from NetBSD.  After Theo left NetBSD, a few people in the
NetBSD group did some other things for the port: Paul Kranenburg
ported a floppy driver and started writing support for the 4/400.
Chuck spent many long hours working on the ie, xy, xd device drivers.

<p>
Theo continued working independently, and made a number of additions:
P4 support, flexible boot strategy, a few graphics drivers with the help
from John Stone, and masses of bug fixes.

<p>
Work on porting OpenBSD/sparc to the sun4m platform was started by Theo,
but tendinitis problems with his wrists and the problems with the NetBSD
core combined made him stop this work. The initial sun4m work was passed
to Aaron Brown of Harvard, who was paid out of Margo Seltzer's research
funds. This initial stuff consisted mostly of a few attempts at building
pmap structure that could support all 3 MMU types efficiently.  Also,
David Miller of the UltraLinux project got a little bit involved.

<p>
Theo and Jason Downs merged the NetBSD sparc code back into OpenBSD, making
OpenBSD/sparc usable again.  Jason Wright wrote a few new SBus Ethernet
drivers with information from the UltraLinux project and has merged a few bits
from NetBSD sources to improve the stability of this architecture.
Over the time, Art Grabowski fixed various stability or reliability issues,
and added non-executable stack and heap on sun4m machines.
The frame buffer and console code was completely overhauled for OpenBSD 3.2,
improving display speed with some frame buffers, and supporting more cards.

<hr>

<h3 id="status"><strong>Current status:</strong></h3>

<p>
Currently, all the hardware listed in the
<a href="#hardware">supported hardware</a> section below boots
multi-user, and supports enough (if not all) of the on-board devices to
be generally usable.
A growing set of third-party SBus cards are also supported.

<p>
The X Window System works on all supported frame buffers, including
multi-head configurations.
No accelerated server is provided at the moment, although this is being
worked on.

<p>
An important note about OpenBSD/sparc is that it is designed so that
a single kernel can run on <strong>ALL SUPPORTED</strong> SPARC machines.  Whereas
SunOS and Solaris have always had separate 'kernel architectures', i.e. sun4,
sun4c, sun4e and sun4m, the same 'GENERIC' OpenBSD kernel will run on all the
supported models.

<p>
Most of the problems with OpenBSD/sparc are believed to stem from the wide
variety of SPARC processor and cache implementations along with their
undocumented bugs, rather than general kernel problems.
Feedback on which models do and do not work reliably is
appreciated, particularly with newer models or upgrades.

<h4>Supported devices</h4>

<p>
This list of devices basically declares that any "stock" sun4c or sun4m
"SPARCstation" or "SPARCserver" machine will probably work; for sun4
and sun4e machines one must be more careful.

<br>

<p>
<h4>Unsupported machines</h4>

<p>
<ul>
 <li>sun4: 4/400 (lacks support for the I/O cache, and has ethernet problems)
 <li>sun4d machines:
   <ul>
      <li>SPARC Server 1000
      <li>SPARC Center 2000
   </ul>
   These machines use XD-Bus instead of M-Bus for their CPUs, which is not
   supported yet.
 <li>JavaStation-NC (lacks support for this machine's PCI bus)
 <li>sun4u: UltraSPARC 64-bit machines.  Most of these are supported in the
      <a href="sparc64.html">OpenBSD/sparc64</a> port.
 <li>Solbourne machines: these machines are quite different, and some are
   plagued by processor bugs.  Some of them were covered by the discontinued
   <a href="solbourne.html">OpenBSD/solbourne</a> port.
 <li>Tadpole SPARCbook 1, LC and 2: these machines use quite unusual components,
   and do not have a Sun-compatible PROM.
</ul>

<li><strong>On-board Audio and ISDN</strong><br>
  This is present on some sun4m systems (LX, LC, SPARCstation 10/20).

<li><strong>Multiple Processors/Modules in sun4m systems</strong><br>
  OpenBSD will sometimes not boot on some machines with multiple processors.
  If this is the case, the extra CPUs must be removed.

<li><strong>SBus SUNW,bpp (parallel port)</strong><br>
  A driver exists in the source tree, but it does not work.  None of the
  developers have printers or cables to work with, to make it work, but
  we really would prefer to receive a fixed driver.

<h3 id="hwdocs"><strong>Hardware documentation:</strong></h3>

Previous to 2007, it was extremely difficult or impossible to get much of
the necessary hardware documentation for these machines.   Members of our
team (in particular David Gwynne) were instrumental in pressuring and
convincing Sun to go back into their archives and dig up the data sheets
that they had written in-house, describing the operation of their chips to
their own engineers.  These documents can now be found at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111209011516/http://wikis.sun.com/display/FOSSdocs/Home">
http://wikis.sun.com/display/FOSSdocs/Home</a>.
Some documents are still missing at that site, so we ask that interested
developers contact Sun and request additional information.

<strong>Getting and installing OpenBSD/sparc:</strong>
</h3>

<p>
The last supported OpenBSD/sparc release was
<a href="59.html">OpenBSD 5.9</a>.
Here are the
<a href="https://ftp.eu.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/5.9/sparc/INSTALL.sparc">
OpenBSD/sparc 5.9 installation instructions</a>.

<p>
There are several installation media provided, so that
OpenBSD/sparc can be installed or upgraded via CD and floppy boot images on
sun4c and sun4m, miniroot images for machines without floppies
(such as sun4 machines), as well as network and diskless installs.
<ul>
  <li><strong>CD boot</strong>
  <p>
  Booting off the CD provides a small ffs filesystem with a GENERIC kernel with
  drivers for all supported devices found on SPARC machines.<br>
  For the latest list of drivers available on this image, take a look at the
<a href="https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/src/sys/arch/sparc/conf/GENERIC?rev=HEAD">GENERIC</a>
kernel configuration file.
  The CD can be booted off the OpenPROM prompt with
<pre>
  boot cdrom 5.9/sparc/bsd.rd
</pre>

  <li><strong>Floppy</strong> (floppy59.fs)
  <p>
  Booting off the floppy provides a small ffs filesystem with a kernel
  containing drivers for the most popular devices found on SPARC machines.<br>
  For the latest list of drivers available on this image, take a look at the
<a href="https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/src/sys/arch/sparc/conf/RAMDISK?rev=HEAD">RAMDISK</a>
kernel configuration file.
  The floppy can be booted off the OpenPROM prompt with
<pre>
  boot floppy
</pre>

  <li><strong>Miniroot</strong> (miniroot59.fs)
  <p>
  The miniroot provides the same installation environment as the bootable CD,
  and is intended for easy bootstrap if there is already an operating system
  installed on the machine.
  After dumping the miniroot to the primary swap partition with dd, the
  miniroot can be booted off the OpenPROM prompt with a command such as
<pre>
  boot disk:b
</pre>
  (the disk designation may be different, depending on the chosen swap
  partition).
  <p>

  <li><strong>Netboot</strong> (boot.net, bsd.rd)
  <p>
  Using a diskless setup, it is also possible to boot the OpenBSD/sparc
  boot loader, <code>boot.net</code>, from the network via tftp, and access
  the <code>bsd.rd</code> standalone miniroot over NFS.
  Refer to the
  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-5.9/diskless.8">diskless(8)</a>
  manual page for details on how to set up a network boot environment.
