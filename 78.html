<li>OpenSSH 10.1
  <ul>
  <li>Security fixes
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        disallow control characters in usernames passed via the
        commandline or expanded using %-sequences from the configuration
        file, and disallow \0 characters in ssh:// URIs.
        <p>
        If an ssh(1) commandline was constructed using usernames or URIs
        obtained from an untrusted source, and if a ProxyCommand that uses
        the %u expansion was configured, then it may be possible for an
        attacker to inject shell expressions that may be executed when the
        proxy command is started.
        <p>
        We strongly recommend against using untrusted inputs to construct
        ssh(1) commandlines.
        <p>
        This change also relaxes the validity checks in one small way:
        usernames supplied via the configuration file as literals (i.e.
        that have no % expansion characters) are not subject to these
        validity checks. This allows usernames that contain arbitrary
        characters to be used, but only via configuration files. This is
        done on the basis that ssh's configuration is trusted.
        <p>
        This issue was reported by David Leadbeater.
    </ul>
  <li>Potentially incompatible changes
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        add a warning when the connection negotiates a non-post
        quantum safe key agreement algorithm.
        <p>
        This warning has been added due to the risk of "store now, decrypt
        later" attacks. More details at the <a
        href="https://openssh.com/pq.html">OpenSSH Post-Quantum Cryptography
        </a> page.
        <p>
        This warning may be controlled via a new <code>WarnWeakCrypto</code>
        ssh_config option, defaulting to on. This option is likely to control
        additional weak crypto warnings in the future.
      <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        major changes to handling of DSCP marking/<code>IPQoS</code>
        <p>
        Both the client and the server have changed the default DCSP
        (a.k.a IPQos) values and the way these values are selected at
        runtime.
        <p>
        Both endpoints now use Expedited Forward (EF) for interactive
        traffic by default. This provides better prioritisation,
        especially on wireless media (cf. RFC 8325). Non-interactive
        traffic now uses the operating system default DSCP marking.
        Both the interactive and non-interactive DSCP values may be
        overridden via the <code>IPQoS</code> keyword in <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5">ssh_config(5)</a> and
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>.
        <p>
        The DSCP value selected may now change over the course of a
        connection. ssh(1) and sshd(8) will automatically select between
        the interactive and non-interactive IPQoS values depending on
        the type of SSH channels open. E.g. if a sftp session is using
        the connectionn, then the non-interactive value will be used.
        <p>
        This is important now that the default interactive IPQoS is EF
        (Expedited Forwarding), as many networks are configured to allow
        only relatively small amounts of traffic of this class and they will
        aggressively deprioritise the entire connection if this is exceeded.
      <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        deprecate support for IPv4 type-of-service (TOS)
        keywords in the IPQoS configuration directive.
        <p>
        Type of Service (ToS) was deprecated in the late nineties and
        replaced with the Differentiated Services architecture. Diffserv
        has significant advantages for operators because this mechanism
        offers more granularity.
        <p>
        OpenSSH switched its default IPQoS from ToS to DSCP values in 2018.
        <p>
        IPQoS configurations with 'lowdelay', 'reliability', or
        'throughput' will be ignored and instead the system default QoS
        settings apply. Additionally, a debug message is logged about the
        deprecation with a suggestion to use DSCP.
      <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1">ssh-add(1)</a>:
        when adding certificates to an agent, set the expiry
        to the certificate expiry time plus a short (5 min) grace period.
        <p>
        This will cause the agent to automtically remove certificates shortly
        after they expire. A new ssh-add -N option disables this behaviour.
      <li>All: remove experimental support for XMSS keys. This was never
        enabled by default. We expect to implement a new post-quantu
        signature scheme in the near future.
      <li>ssh-agent(1), sshd(8): move agent listener sockets from /tmp to
        under ~/.ssh/agent for both ssh-agent(1) and forwarded sockets
        in sshd(8).
        <p>
        This ensures processes that have restricted filesystem access
        that includes /tmp do not ambiently have the ability to use keys
        in an agent.
        <p>
        Moving the default directory has the consequence that the OS will
        no longer clean up stale agent sockets, so ssh-agent now gains
        this ability.
        <p>
        To support $HOME on NFS, the socket path includes a truncated hash of
        the hostname. ssh-agent will by default only clean up sockets from
        the same hostname.
        <p>
        ssh-agent(1) gains some new flags: -U suppresses the automatic
        cleanup of stale sockets when it starts. -u forces a cleanup
        without keeping a running agent, -uu forces a cleanup that ignores
        the hostname. -T makes ssh-agent put the socket back in /tmp.
    </ul>

  <li>New features
    <ul>
      <li>ssh(1), sshd(8): add SIGINFO handlers to log active channel and
        session information.
      <li>sshd(8): when refusing a certificate for user authentication, log
         enough information to identify the certificate in addition to the
         reason why it was being denied. Makes debugging certificate
         authorisation problems a bit easier.
      <li>ssh(1), ssh-agent(1): support ed25519 keys hosted on PKCS#11
         tokens.
      <li>ssh(1): add a ssh_config(5) RefuseConnection option that, when
          encountered while processing an active section in a
          configuration terminates ssh(1) with an error message that
          contains the argument to the option.
        <p>
          This may be useful for expressing reminders or warnings in config
          files, for example:
        <pre>
          Match host foo
              RefuseConnection "foo is deprecated, use splork instead"
        </pre>
      <li>sshd(8): make the X11 display number check relative to
        X11DisplayOffset. This will allows people to use X11DisplayOffset
        to configure much higher port ranges if they really want, while
        not changing the default behaviour.
      <li>unit tests: the unit test framework now includes some basic
        benchmarking capabilities. Run with "make UNITTEST_BENCHMARK=yes".
    </ul>

  <li>Bugfixes
    <ul>
      <li>sshd(8): fix mistracking of MaxStartups process exits in some
        situations. At worst, this could cause all MaxStartups slots to
        fill and sshd to refuse new connections.
      <li>ssh(1): fix delay on X client startup when ObscureKeystrokeTiming
        is enabled.
      <li>sshd(8): increase the maximum size of the supported configuration
        from 256KB to 4MB, which ought to be enough for anybody. Fail
        early and visibly when this limit is breached.
      <li>sftp(1): during sftp uploads, avoid a condition where a failed
        write could be ignored if a subsequent write succeeded. This is
        unlikely but technically possible because sftp servers are
        allowed to reorder requests.
      <li>sshd(8): avoid a race condition when the sshd-auth process exits
        tha could cause a spurious error message to be logged.
      <li>sshd(8): log at level INFO when PerSourcePenalties actually
        blocks access to a source address range. Previously this was
        logged at level VERBOSE, which hid enforcement actions under
        default config settings.
      <li>sshd(8): GssStrictAcceptor was missing from sshd -T output; fix
      <li>sshd(8): Make the MaxStartups and PerSourceNetBlockSize options
        first-match-wins as advertised.
      <li>ssh(1): fix an incorrect return value check in the local forward
        cancellation path that would cause failed cancellations not to be
        logged.
      <li>sshd(8): make "Match !final" not trigger a 2nd pass ssh_config
        parsing pass (unless hostname canonicalisation or a separate
        "Match final" does).
      <li>ssh(1): better debug diagnostics when loading keys. Will now list
        key fingerprint and algorithm (not just algorithm number) as well
        as making it explicit which keys didn't load.
      <li>All: fix a number of memory leaks found by LeakSanitizer,
        Coverity and manual inspection.
      <li>sshd(8): : Output the current name for PermitRootLogin's
        "prohibit-password" in sshd -T instead of its deprecated alias
        "without-password".
      <li>ssh(1): make writing known_hosts lines more atomic by writing
        the entire line in one operation and using unbuffered stdio.
        <p>
        Usually writes to this file are serialised on the "Are you sure you
        want to continue connecting?" prompt, but if host key checking is
        disabled and connections were being made with high concurrency
        then interleaved writes might have been possible.
    </ul>
  </ul>

<section id="quickinstall">
<p>
Quick installer information for people familiar with OpenBSD, and the use of
the "<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel</a> -E" command.
If you are at all confused when installing OpenBSD, read the relevant
INSTALL.* file as listed above!

<h3>OpenBSD/alpha:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install78.iso</i> or
<i>cd78.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/amd64:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install78.iso</i> or
<i>cd78.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install78.img</i> or
<i>miniroot78.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included
INSTALL.amd64 document.

<p>
If you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.amd64.

<h3>OpenBSD/arm64:</h3>

<p>
Depending on your hardware, you can write <i>install78.iso</i>
or <i>cd78.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it, or write a system specific
miniroot to an SD card and boot from it after connecting to the serial
console.  Refer to INSTALL.armv64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/armv7:</h3>

<p>
Write a system specific miniroot to an SD card and boot from it after connecting
to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.armv7 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/hppa:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network by following the instructions in INSTALL.hppa or the
<a href="hppa.html#install">hppa platform page</a>.

<h3>OpenBSD/i386:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install78.iso</i> or
<i>cd78.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install78.img</i> or
<i>miniroot78.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in
the included INSTALL.i386 document.

<p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.i386.

<h3>OpenBSD/landisk:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot78.img</i> to the start of the CF
or disk, and boot normally.

<h3>OpenBSD/loongson:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot78.img</i> to a USB stick and boot bsd.rd from it
or boot bsd.rd via tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.loongson for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/luna88k:</h3>

<p>
Copy 'boot' and 'bsd.rd' to a Mach or UniOS partition, and boot the bootloader
from the PROM, and then bsd.rd from the bootloader.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.luna88k for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>
Burn the <i>install78.iso</i> image from a mirror site to a CDROM,
and power on your machine while holding down the <i>C</i> key until
the display turns on and shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/7.8/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

<h3>OpenBSD/octeon:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, boot bsd.rd over the network via DHCP/tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.octeon for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/powerpc64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install78.img</i> or <i>miniroot78.img</i> to a
USB stick, plug it into the machine and choose the <i>OpenBSD
install</i> menu item in Petitboot.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.powerpc64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/riscv64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install78.img</i> or <i>miniroot78.img</i> to a
USB stick, and boot with that drive plugged in.
Make sure you also have the microSD card plugged in that shipped with the
HiFive Unmatched board.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.riscv64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy78.img</i> or <i>floppyB78.img</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>miniroot78.img</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 7.7 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade78.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.
</section>

<section id="sourcecode">
<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.
</section>

<section id="ports">
<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr/ports</kbd>
# <kbd>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_7_8</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 7.8 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
