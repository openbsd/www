		the aliasing noise during resampling.
	<li>Disabled <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sndiod.8">sndiod(8)</a>
		autovolume by default and set the default volume to 127. Setting "-w
		on" will replicate the previous behavior of automatically decreasing
		playback volume when new programs start playing.
	<li>Allowed mixing of alternative devices (-F) with different
		capabilities in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/sndiod.8">sndiod(8)</a> by treating any

		"-r" would install firmware packages from snapshots.
	<li>Increased speed of the dependency check pass for <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1">pkg_add(1)</a>.

	<li>Prevented process exit in multithreaded programs from reporting
		the wrong error code.

	<li>Allowed booting of amd64/i386 from GPT formatted disks larger than 4TB.

	<li>Made editing GPT in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a> safer by
		defaulting offset to the beginning of the largest free space and
		preventing the creation of overlapping partitions.
	<li>Fixed a crash that could occur in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/sndiod.8">sndiod(8)</a> when a USB
		device is unplugged.
	<li>Append .html suffixes to temporary files in <a

		command line.
	<li>Added a "batch" mode to <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1">mg(1)</a> via the "-b" command
		line option which will initialize a pty, run the specified file of mg
		commands and then exit.
	<li>Inverted the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1">mg(1)</a> "R"
		indicator to mean that a "*" next to a file's name indicates that it
		is read-only. Made the active buffer indicator more visible by
		changing it to ">".

	<li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1">ksh(1)</a>
		redrawing of a multiline PS1 prompt in vi mode and added support for

	<li>Stopped deleting the control socket on exit in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/apmd.8">apmd(8)</a>, as deleting
		the socket after calling <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/unveil.2">unveil(2)</a> would cause an
		unveil violation.
  </ul>

<li>Improved hardware support and driver bugfixes, including:
  <ul>
	<li>Corrected accounting of zero length Transfer Descriptors in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/xhci.4">xhci(4)</a>, preventing running

		href="https://man.openbsd.org/mfokrtc.4">mfokrtc(4)</a>.
	<li>Fixed brightness setting on MacBooks.
	<li>Added AMD Vi and Intel VTD IOMMU support. This creates separate
		domains for each PCI device and can provide protection against invalid
		memory access.
	<li>Enabled brightness keys on powerbooks where the keyboard attaches
		as <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ukbd.4">ukbd(4)</a>.
	<li>Set initial default display brightness on macppc via

		INQUIRY command succeeds but with a residue equal to the requested
		bytes.
	<li>Added Gemini Lake I2C id to <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/dwiic.4">dwiic(4)</a>, making the
		touchpad work on the Teclast F7 Plus laptop.
	<li>Introduced <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ujoy.4">ujoy(4)</a>, a
		restricted subset of <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/uhid.4">uhid(4)</a> for game controllers
		which uses /dev/ujoy/* device nodes.
	<li>Set up <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ims.4">ims(4)</a> devices
		in X11 to behave like touchpads.
	<li>Stopped relying on USB devices to correctly present their
		indices, instead searching for the correct interfaces. This fixes E+
		Corp. DAC Audio devices.
	<li>Introduced <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/uhidpp.4">uhidpp(4)</a>, a driver for
		Logitech HID++ devices.
	<li>Separated reading of general and touchpad-specific <a

		href="https://man.openbsd.org/mvneta.4">mvneta(4)</a>.
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mvsw.4">mvsw(4)</a>, a
		driver for Marvel "SOHO" switches.
	<li>Enabled auto-negotiation on the SerDes links, allowing
		in-band-status to work between <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/mvpp.4">mvpp(4)</a> and <a

  </ul>

<li>Added or improved wireless network drivers:
  <ul>
	<li>Fixed the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/athn.4">athn(4)</a> and
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/urtwn.4">urtwn(4)</a> drivers
		in client mode against access points which use WPA1/TKIP as
		the group cipher.
	<li>Added multicast support to <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/bwfm.4">bwfm(4)</a> to allow IPv6.
	<li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/urtwn.4">urtwn(4)</a>
		repeated DEAUTH and loss/restoration of link.
	<li>Introduced a delay to work around an issue in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/bwfm.4">bwfm(4)</a> on the BCM43602 that
		was triggering "unexpected pairwise key update" errors.
	<li>Enabled <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/athn.4">athn(4)</a> for arm64.
	<li>Implemented a new 802.11n Tx rate adaptation algorithm ("RA") for
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm.4">iwm(4)</a>,
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwn.4">iwn(4)</a>, and
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/athn.4">athn(4)</a>.
	<li>Fixed association problems with the <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipw.4">ipw(4)</a> and <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwi.4">iwi(4)</a> drivers.
	<li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwx.4">iwx(4)</a> attach to
		AX201 devices with PCI IDs 0x34f0 and 0x06f0. Needs <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/fw_update.1">fw_update(1)</a>.
	<li>Fixed a problem where <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwn.4">iwn(4)</a> firmware would
		generate bogus block ack requests and stall traffic.
  	<li>Fixed automatic channel selection in the <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/athn.4">athn(4)</a> driver
		when running in hostap or monitor mode.
  </ul>

<li>IEEE 802.11 wireless stack improvements and bugfixes:
  <ul>
	<li>Fixed length calculations in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm.4">iwm(4)</a> and <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwx.4">iwx(4)</a> when there are
		multiple MPDUs in one packet.
	<li>Fixed 802.11n interoperability with access points that offer
		management frame protection.
	<li>Flush the A-MPDU reorder buffer after gap timeout to prevent
		frames from remaining in the buffer until the next frame
		is received.
	<li>Avoid spurious "input packet decapsulations failed" errors in
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/netstat.1">netstat(1)</a> -W with
		A-MSDU enabled.
  	<li>Fixed automatic selection of the 11a/b/g/n/ac operating mode when
		the interface is running as an access point.
	<li>Ensured crypto keys are installed before the link is brought up.
  </ul>

<li>Generic network stack improvements and bugfixes:
  <ul>
	<li>Removed the maxburst feature from tcp_output().
		Sending out TCP segments was limited to 4 packets per burst.
		This did not scale well on high bandwidth, high latency links.
		Especially when the receiving side delays ACK packets
		aggressively, the maxburst limitation could seriously reduce
		TCP throughput per connection.
	<li>Added a MONITOR feature to interfaces. Packets received on these
		interfaces do not enter the network stack for further processing. This
		can be used to watch traffic, for example with <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/bpf.4">bpf(4)</a> without risk of the packets
		interfering with the system.

	<li>Added etherbridge, the internals of a reusable learning bridge
		interface providing common code reusable for other drivers needing a
		mac learning bridge.
	<li>Introduced <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/veb.4">veb(4)</a>, a
		Virtual Ethernet Bridge driver.

	<li>Added the ability to force the selection of source IP address for
		programs that do not specify a source IP, overriding the default
		source IP selection algorithm. This is configurable via <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/route.8">route(8)</a>
		<code>sourceaddr</code> command.

	<li>Bring interfaces up when autoconfiguration for inet or inet6 is
		enabled (AUTOCONF4 or AUTOCONF6 flags).
	<li>Adjust terminology in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a> to refer to
		"temporary address extensions" rather than the former "privacy
		extensions," including the addition of an AUTOCONF6TEMP flag (to
		replace the negative flag "INET6_NOPRIVACY").  The autoconfprivacy
		option if <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a>
		has been deprecated.
	<li>Made it possible to disable the "autoconf" flag but keep
		"temporary" enabled in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a>.
	<li>For IPv6 addresses, added tracking of address proposal creation
		times to be able to establish total lifetime. This information is used
		to renew pltime/vltime of privacy addresse per RFC 4941.

	<li>Prevented kernel reuse of mbuf memory when generating the ICMP6
		response to an IPv6 packet.
	<li>Use the toeplitz hash algorithm to a flowid for tcp packets,
		which in turn is used to choose the tx ring on network cards with
		multiple rings.
	<li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wg.4">wg(4)</a> on macppc
		by keeping track of allowed ips pointer correctly.
	<li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wg.4">wg(4)</a> ioctl to
		handle multiple wgpeers.
	<li>Fixed a race between tx/rx handshakes in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/wg.4">wg(4)</a>.
	<li>Prevented a potential hang when trying to remove a <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/tun.4">tun(4)</a> interface.
	<li>Used the correct rdomain when adding and deleting routes with <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/mpip.4">mpip(4)</a> and <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/mpw.4">mpw(4)</a>.
	<li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a>
		"-mplslabel" work with <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/mpw.4">mpw(4)</a>.
  </ul>

<li>Installer and upgrade improvements:
  <ul>
	<li>Prevented a race in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a> privsep
		which could cause autoinstall to fail by calling <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/ftp.1">ftp(1)</a> without a local
		address.
	<li>Fixed hangs on amd64 bsd.rd due to misreported core clock
		frequency on newer Intel Comet Lake models.
	<li>Began distributing the gzip'd version of bsd.rd on all platforms
		with boot methods supporting it.
	<li>Fixed a problem which prevented use of <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade.8">sysupgrade(8)</a> when an
		interface failed to come up and <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a> didn't
		notice link-timeout expiration.
	<li>Prevented <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel(8)</a> from
		adjusting the swap 'b' partition size if physmem is zero to keep the
		auto-allocate code from putting a filesystem on that partition.
	<li>Emulate "[inet] autoconf" <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/hostname.if.5">hostname.if(5)</a> lines
		with "dhcp" so users testing <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpleased.8">dhcpleased(8)</a> will
		still be able to upgrade manually while the installer uses only <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a>.
	<li>Restored <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.conf.5">dhclient.conf(5)</a>
		to the group of network configuration files used during upgrades.

 </ul>

<li>Security improvements:
  <ul>
	<li>Added notices to syslog whenever the "%n" format string component
		of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/printf.3">printf(3)</a> is used.
	<li>Removed workaround permitting Go executables to do syscalls
		directly, forcing them to use shared libc like all other dynamic
		binaries.
  </ul>

<li>Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a> daemon saw the following changes:
    <ul>
	<li>Introduced <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>
		<code>rde evaluate all</code> to reduce path hiding in IXP
		route-server environments.
	<li>Added RTR support to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">OpenBGPD</a>.
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpctl.8">bgpctl(8)</a>
		"show rtr" to display basic information about RTR sessions.
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpctl.8">bgpctl(8)</a>
		"show sets" to display information about the roa-set, as-sets and
		prefix-sets loaded into <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>.
	<li>Properly implemented "rde med compare strict" in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a> and ensured that the
		order of prefixes is always correct.
	<li>Introduced a send hold timer in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a> to detect stalls on
		the sending side of a TCP connection, acting as a last resort to
		detect faulty peers.
	<li>Introduced the <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.conf.5">bgpd.conf(5)</a> per
		neighbor and global config option "reject as-set yes/no" to allow
		rejection of received UPDATES with AS_SET segments. These rejected
		prefixes can be viewed with <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpctl.8">bgpctl(8)</a> "show rib in
		error".
	<li>No longer allow configuration of the same neighbor multiple
		times in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>.
	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> tables track now
		prefixes correctly even when received by multiple sessions.
	<li>Fixed a memory leak when parsing <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a> roa-set lists.
    </ul>

    <li>The <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ospfd.8">ospfd(8)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ospf6d.8">ospf6d(8)</a>  routing
	daemons saw various internal refactoring to keep the code similar to
	changes in other routing daemons and improve maintainability.<br>
	Additionally, support for point-to-point interfaces in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ospf6d.8">ospf6d(8)</a>was fixed and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ospfd.8">ospfd(8)</a> now works with
	point-to-point interfaces which use a common IP address.

    <li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> packet filter and its userland utility:
    <ul>
	<li>Relaxed checks in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl.8">pfctl(8)</a> and <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> to accept any valid
		routing domain, even if it does not yet exist.
	<li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl.8">pfctl(8)</a>
		detect and reject bogus ranges before loading the ruleset to prevent a
		panic.
	<li>Changed route-to in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf.5">pf.conf(5)</a> to send
		packets to IPs instead of interfaces.
	<li>Changed pf_route so <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> only runs when packets
		enter and leave the stack. Running the same packet through pf multiple
		times creates confusion for the state table. By default, pf states are
		floating, meaning that packets are matched to states regardless of
		which interface they're going over. This diff avoids multiple pf(4)
		traversals of one packet causing confusion in the state table.
	<li>Prevented the kernel from being stuck in an endless recursion
		during TCP path MTU discovery when <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> changes the routing
		table when sending packets.
	<li>When cutting off the head of an overlapping fragment during <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> reassembly, reinserted
		the fragment into the lookup table with the correct index.

	<li>Improved
		<href="https://man.openbsd.org/tftpd.8">tftpd(8)</a> logging to report the reasons
		a transfer failed.

    </ul>

    <li>IPSEC support in the kernel and the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> userland daemon:
    <ul>
	<li>Added support to request IP addresses as IKEv2 initiator to <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>. If 'request addr
		0.0.0.0' is configured, any address will be accepted.
	<li>Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> accept
		ANY dynamic address with 'request addr 0.0.0.0'.
	<li>Added 'dynamic' keyword to <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.conf.5">iked.conf(5)</a> to allow
		configuration of flows to dynamically assigned addresses.
	<li>Added the 'any' keyword to <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.conf.5">iked.conf(5)</a> for
		requests to allow "request address any".
	<li>Enabled <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>
		support for ASN1_DN ipsec identifiers.
	<li>Implemented <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>
		"from dynamic," installing flows where "dynamic" is replaced by the
		received dynamic IP address.
	<li>Made sure not to replace 0.0.0.0 with a dynamic address in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> if it is a network
		address.
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> -s
		socket option to specify a control socket.
	<li>Used a counter instead of random IV for AES-GCM in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>, eliminating the
		risk of random collisions.
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>
		support for multiple address pools.
	<li>Added the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>
		"set stickyaddress" option, which attempts to assign the same "config
		address" when an IKESA is negotiated with the DSTID of an existing
		IKESA.
	<li>Ensured rekeying of every child SA in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>.
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> support
		for RSASSA-PSS signature verification (RFC 7427).
	<li>Corrected the first packet of an <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsec.4">ipsec(4)</a> SA to have
		sequence number 1.
	<li>Accepted reject and blackhole routes for IPsec PMTU discovery.
	<li>Prevented leaking of ipsec_hosts in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> when building
		hosts_list.
	<li>Prevented initiation of new additional SAs for each policy upon
		every <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ikectl.8">ikectl(8)</a> config
		reload.
	<li>Fixed "any" and "dynamic" keywords for flows in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> and added proper
		IPv6 support.
	<li>Created a path MTU host route for <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsec.4">IPsec(4)</a> over IPv6.
	<li>Added support for INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> CREATE_CHILD_SA
		exchange.
	<li>Added support for RSA-PSS PKCS1 signatures to <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>.
	<li>Fixed path MTU discovery for ESP tunnels in IPv6.
	<li>Upgraded to OpenSSL 1.1 compatible crypto API in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>.
	<li>Added an optional "group none" transform for child SAs in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> to ensure the
		ability to negotiate optional PFS.
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>
		dynamic address configuration for roadwarrior clients, with a new
		"iface" config option which can be used to specify an interface for
		the virtual addresses received from the peer.
	<li>Fixed an <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>
		interop problem with strongswan if make-before-break is enabled.
    </ul>

    <li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a> webserver saw numerous improvements:
    <ul>
	<li>Prevented a crash due to
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a> listening on port
		443 with missing TLS certificates.
	<li>Created a new "location (found|notfound)" option for
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.conf.5">httpd.conf(5)</a> to allow
		testing for resource path existence.
	<li>Fixed detection of duplicate locations in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a>.
	<li>Fixed leak of access and error log filenames on config reload in
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a>.
	<li>Avoid leaking the log message in
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a>'s
		server_sendlog.
	<li>Incorrect order of
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/close.2">close(2)</a> and
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tls_close.3">tls_close(3)</a>
		together with a bug in libssl led to leaking memory in
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a>
		for each TLS connection.
	<li>Fixed the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a>
		example configuration not to generate errors when running without TLS
		keys already in place.
	<li>Optimized disk reads of
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a>
		by using st_blocksize as high water mark instead of
		the socket buffer size.
	<li>Do not compare TLS config params for non-TLS servers.
		This allows using <code>listen on * port 80</code> and
		<code>listen on * port 443</code> in the same server block in
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.conf.5">httpd.conf(5)</a>.
    </ul>

    <li><a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpki-client.8">rpki-client(8)</a>
	received the following new features and bugfixes:
    <ul>
	<li>Added RRDP (The RPKI Repository Delta Protocol, RFC 8182) support
		as a 'technology preview'. To use it, the "-r" flag needs to be used.
	<li>Support the use of more than one URI in the TAL file,
		sorting with a preference for https.
	<li>Validation of ghostbuster records (RFC 6493).
	<li>Fixed checks of the manifest validity interval.
	<li>The rsync connection is now killed when the rsync server stalls.
	<li>Limited the URL embedded in .cer files to
		alphanumeric characters and punctuation.
	<li>Added a "-V" option to show version.
	<li>Included the default cert.pem file path in tls_load_file error
		messages.
    </ul>

    <li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dig.1">dig(1)</a> DNS
	utility received the following updates:
    <ul>
	<li>Implemented RFC 8914 Extended DNS Errors for <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/dig.1">dig(1)</a>.
	<li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dig.1">dig(1)</a> EDNS
		Client Subnet option (+subnet=).
	<li>Fixed IPv6 link-local address handling for nameservers to talk to
		and address to bind to in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/dig.1">dig(1)</a>.

	<li>Exit immediately if the -i option contains invalid information.
	</ul>

    <li>Two new daemons, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpleased.8">dhcpleased(8)</a> and <a

	<li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ftp.1">ftp(1)</a> set
		timestamps only on files.

	<li>Added requests for a new certificate without requiring -F when <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.1">acme-client(1)</a>
		detects an added or removed SAN in the config file not reflected in
		the existing certificate on disk.
	<li>Print rewritten addresses in <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/tcpdump.8">tcpdump(8)</a> logged with <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/pflog.4">pflog(4)</a> for rdr-to, nat-to
		and af-to rules.
	<li>When calling <a
		href="https://man.openbsd.org/getaddrinfo.3">getaddrinfo(3)</a> with

	<li>Added a -C flag to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> run-shell to use a tmux command rather than a shell command.
	<li>Added a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> -N flag to never start the server even if the command would normally do so.
	<li>Added the new <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> -S flag to new-window to select the existing window if one with the given name already exists, rather than failing.
	<li>Added support for X11 color names and other variations for OSC 10/11 and added OSC 110 and 111 to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a>.
	<li>Removed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> support for popups where the content is provided directly to tmux.
	<li>Added a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> "absolute-centre" alignment to use the center of the total space instead of the available space.
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> split-window -Z to start the pane zoomed.
	<li>Added client-detached notification in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> control mode.

		TLS listeners may be configured with multiple certificates,
		the matching is based on the names included in these certificates.
	<li>Allow to specify tls protocols and ciphers per listener and relay action.
  </ul>

<li>LibreSSL 3.3.2
  <ul>
    <li>New Features
    <ul>
	<li>Support for DTLSv1.2.
	<li>Continued rewrite of the record layer for the legacy stack.

    </ul>

    <li>Portable Improvements
    <ul>
	<li>Added '--enable-libtls-only' build option, which builds and installs a

	    for systems that ship with OpenSSL but wish to also package libtls.

	<li>Update getentropy on Windows to use Cryptography Next Generation
	    (CNG). wincrypt is deprecated and no longer works with newer Windows
	    environments, such as in Windows Store apps.

	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/EVP_PKEY_new_CMAC_key.3">EVP_PKEY_new_CMAC_key(3)</a>.


	<li>Document
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_use_certificate_chain_file.3">SSL_use_certificate_chain_file(3)</a>.

	<li>Document
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_set_hostflags.3">SSL_set_hostflags(3)</a>
	    and
           <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_get0_peername.3">SSL_get0_peername(3)</a>.

	<li>Update

	<li>Set SO_REUSEADDR on the server socket in the
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openssl.1">openssl(1)</a> ocsp command.

	<li>Send a host header with OCSP queries to make
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openssl.1">openssl(1)</a> ocsp
	    work with some widely used OCSP responders.

	<li>Add ability to
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ocspcheck.8">ocspcheck(8)</a>
	    to parse a port in the specified OCSP URL.

	<li>Implement auto chain for the TLSv1.3 server since some software
	    relies on this.

	<li>Implement key exporter for TLSv1.3.
	<li>Align <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_get_shared_ciphers.3">SSL_get_shared_ciphers(3)</a>
	    with OpenSSL. This takes into account that it never returned server
	    ciphers, so now it will fail when called from the client side.

	<li>Sync cert.pem with Mozilla NSS root CAs except "GeoTrust Global CA".

	<li>Make
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_CTX_get_min_proto_version.3">SSL{_CTX,}_get_{min,max}_proto_version(3)</a>
	    return a version of zero if the minimum or maximum has been set to
	    zero to match OpenSSL's behavior.

	<li>Add DTLSv1.2 support to

	    x509v3_cache_extensions().

	<li>Refactor and clean up
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ocspcheck.8">ocspcheck(8)</a>
	    and add regression tests.
    </ul>

    <li>Internal Improvements
      <ul>
	<li>Further cleanup of the DTLS record handling.

	<li>Continue the replacement of the TLSv1.2 record layer by
	    reimplementing the read side of the TLSv1.2 record handling.

	<li>Replace DTLSv1_enc_data() with TLSv1_1_enc_data().

	<li>Merge d1_{clnt,srvr}.c into ssl_{clnt,srvr}.c.

	<li>Add const to ssl_ciphers and tls1[23]_sigalgs* to push them into
	    .data.rel.ro and .rodata, respectively.

	<li>Add a const qualifier to srtp_known_profiles.

	<li>Simplify TLS method by removing the client and server specific
	    methods internally.

	<li>Avoid casting away const in ssl_ctx_make_profiles().

	<li>Avoid explicitly conditioning an assert on DTLS1_VERSION to make
	    the assert work for newer DTLS versions.

	<li>Merge SSL_ENC_METHOD into SSL_METHOD_INTERNAL.

	<li>Add a flag to mark DTLS methods as DTLS to have an easy way to
	    recognize DTLS methods that avoids inspecting the version number.

	<li>Mark a few more internal static tables const.

	<li>Switch finish{,_peer}_md_len from an int to a size_t.

	<li>Use EVP_MD_MAX_MD_SIZE instead of 2 * EVP_MD_MAX_MD_SIZE as size
	    for cert_verify_md[], finish_md[] and peer_finish_md[]. The factor 2
	    was a historical artefact.

	<li>Free struct members in tls13_record_layer_free() in their natural
	    order for reviewability.

	<li>Use consistent names in tls13_{client,server}_finished_{recv,send}().

	<li>Add tls13_secret_{init,cleanup}() and use them throughout the
	    TLSv1.3 code base.

	<li>Move the read MAC key into the TLSv1.2 record layer.

	<li>Make tls12_record_layer_free() NULL safe.

	<li>Split the record protection from the TLSv1.2 record layer.

	<li>Clean up sequence number handling in the new TLSv1.2 record layer.

	<li>Clean up sequence number handling in DTLS.

	<li>Clean up dtls1_reset_seq_numbers().

	<li>Factor out code for explicit IV length, block size and MAC length
	    from tls12_record_layer_open_record_protected_cipher().

	<li>Provide record layer overhead for DTLS.

	<li>Provide functions to determine if TLSv1.2 record protection is
	    engaged.

	<li>Add code to handle change of cipher state in the new TLSv1.2 record
	    layer.

	<li>Mop up now unused dtls1_build_sequence_numbers() function.

	<li>Allow setting a keypair on a tls context without specifying the
	    private key, and fake it internally in libtls. This removes the
	    need for privsep engines like relayd to use bogus keys.

	<li>Skip the private key check for fake private keys.

	<li>Move the private key setup from tls_configure_ssl_keypair() to a
	    helper function with proper error checking.

	<li>Change the internal tls_configure_ssl_keypair() function to
	    return -1 instead of 1 on failure.

	<li>Move sequence numbers into the new TLSv1.2 record layer.

	<li>Move AEAD handling into the new TLSv1.2 record layer.

	<li>Factor out legacy stack version checks.

	<li>Correct handshake MAC/PRF for various TLSv1.2 cipher suites which
	    were originally added with the default handshake MAC and PRF rather
	    than the SHA256 handshake MAC and PRF.

	<li>Absorb ssl3_get_algorithm2() into ssl_get_handshake_evp_md().

	<li>Use dtls1_record_retrieve_buffered_record() to load buffered
	    application data.

	<li>Enforce read ahead with DTLS.

	<li>Remove bogus DTLS checks that disabled ECC and OCSP.

	<li>Clean up and simplify dtls1_get_cipher().

	<li>Group HelloVerifyRequest decoding and add missing check for trailing
	    data.

	<li>Revise HelloVerifyRequest handling for DTLSv1.2.

	<li>Handle DTLS1_2_VERSION in various places.

	<li>Rename the "truncated" label into "decode_err" and the "f_err"
	    label into "fatal_err".

	<li>Factor out and change some of the legacy client version code.

	<li>Simplify version checks in the TLSv1.3 client. Ensure that the
	    server announced TLSv1.3 and nothing higher and check that the
	    legacy_version is set to TLSv1.2 as required by RFC 8446.

	<li>Only use TLS versions internally rather than both TLS and DTLS
	    versions since the latter are the one's complement of the human
	    readable version numbers, which means that newer versions decrease
	    in value.

	<li>Identify DTLS based on the version major value.

	<li>Move handling of cipher/hash based cipher suites into the new record
	    layer.

	<li>Add tls12_record_protection_unused() and call it from CCS functions.

	<li>Move key/IV length checks closer to usage sites. Also add explicit
	    checks against
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/EVP_CIPHER_iv_length.3">EVP_CIPHER_{iv,key}_length()</a>.

	<li>Replace two handrolled tls12_record_protection_engaged().

	<li>Improve internal version handling: add handshake fields for our
	    minimum version, our maximum version and the TLS version negotiated
	    during the handshake. Convert most of the internal code to use these
	    version fields.

	<li>Guard against future internal use of TLS1_get_{client,}_version()
	    macros.

	<li>Remove the internal ssl_downgrade_max_version() function which is no
	    longer needed.

	<li>Add support for DTLSv1.2 version handling.

	<li>Remove no longer needed read ahead workarounds in the s_client and
	    s_server.

	<li>Split TLSv1.3 record protection from record layer.

	<li>Move the TLSv1.3 handshake struct inside the shared handshake
	    struct.

	<li>Fully initialize rrec in tls12_record_layer_open_record_protected()
	    to avoid confusing some static analyzers.

	<li>Use tls_set_errorx() on OCSP_basic_verify() failure since the latter
	    does not set errno.

	<li>Convert openssl(1) x509 to new option handling and do the usual
	    clean up that goes along with it.

	<li>Add SSL_HANDSHAKE_TLS12 for TLSv1.2 specific handshake data.

	<li>Rename new_cipher to cipher to align naming with keyblock or other
	    parts of the handshake data.

	<li>Move the TLSv1.2 record number increment into the new record layer.

	<li>Move finished and peer finished into the handshake struct.

	<li>Remove pointless assignment in SSL_get0_alpn_selected().

	<li>Add some error checking to openssl(1) x509.
      </ul>

    <li>Bug Fixes
    <ul>
	<li>Move point-on-curve check to set_affine_coordinates to avoid
	    verifying ECDSA signatures with unchecked public keys.

	<li>Fix
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_is_server.3">SSL_is_server(3)</a>
	    to behave as documented by re-introducing the client-specific
	    methods.

	<li>Avoid undefined behavior due to memcpy(NULL, NULL, 0).

	<li>Make SSL_get{,_peer}_finished() work when used with TLSv1.3.

	<li>Correct the return value type from ERR_peek_error() to a long.

	<li>Avoid use of uninitialized in ASN1_time_parse() which could happen
	    on parsing UTCTime if the caller did not initialize the passed
	    struct tm.

	<li>Destroy the mutex in a tls_config object on tls_config_free().

	<li>Free alert_data and phh_data in tls13_record_layer_free()
	    these could leak if
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_shutdown.3">SSL_shutdown(3)</a>
	    or <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tls_close.3">tls_close(3)</a>
            were called after closing the underlying socket().

	<li>Gracefully handle root certificates being both trusted and
	    untrusted.

	<li>Handle X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE in the new
	    verifier.

	<li>Use the legacy verifier when building auto chains for TLS.

	<li>Search the intermediates only after searching the root certs in the
	    new verifier to avoid problems with the legacy callback.

	<li>Bail out early after finding a single chain in the new verifier, if
	    we have been called via the legacy verifier API.

	<li>Set (invalid and likely incomplete) chain on the xsc on chain build
	    failure prior to calling the callback. This is required by various
	    callers, including auto chain.

	<li>Remove direct assignment of aead_ctx to avoid a leak.

	<li>Fail early in legacy exporter if the master secret is not available
	    to avoid a segfault if it is called when the handshake is not
	    completed.

	<li>Only print the certificate file once on verification failure.

	<li>Fix an off-by-one in x509_verify_set_xsc_chain() to make sure that
	    the new validator checks for EXFLAG_CRITICAL in
	    x509_vfy_check_chain_extension() for all untrusted certs in the
	    chain. Take into account that the root is not necessarily trusted.

	<li>Avoid passing last and depth to x509_verify_cert_error() on ENOMEM.

	<li>Fix two bugs in the legacy verifier that resulted from refactoring
	    of
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/X509_verify_cert.3">X509_verify_cert(3)</a>
	    for the new verifier: a return value was incorrectly treated as
	    boolean, making it insufficient to decide whether validation should
	    carry on or not.

	<li>Fix checks for memory caps of constraints names. There are internal
	    caps on the number of name constraints and other names, that the new
	    name constraints code allocates per cert chain. These limits were
	    checked too late, making them only partially effective.

	<li>Fix a copy-paste error - skid was confused with an akid when
	    checking for EXFLAG_INVALID. This broke OCSP validation with
	    certain mirrors.

	<li>Avoid a use-after-scope in tls13_cert_add().

	<li>Avoid mangled output in BIO_debug_callback().

	<li>Fix client initiated renegotiation by replacing use of s->internal-type
	    with s->server.

	<li>Avoid transcript initialization when sending a TLS HelloRequest,
	    fixing server initiated renegotiation.

	<li>Avoid leaking param->name in x509_verify_param_zero().

	<li>Avoid a leak in an error path in openssl(1) x509.

	<li>When sending an alert in TLSv1.3, only set its error code when no
	    other error was set previously. Certain clients rely on specific
	    SSL_R_ error codes to identify that they are dealing with a self
	    signed cert.

	<li>When switching from the TLSv1.3 stack to the legacy stack include
	    a TLS record header. This is necessary if there is more than one
	    handshake message in the TLS plaintext record.

	<li>Fix resource handling on error in OCSP_request_add0_id().

	<li>Make sure there is enough room for stashing the handshake message
	    when switching to the legacy TLS stack.

	<li>Fix a memory leak in the openssl(1) s_client.

	<li>Unbreak DTLS retransmissions for flights that include a CCS.

	<li>If x509_verify() fails, ensure that the error is set on both
	    the x509_verify_ctx() and its store context to make some failures
	    visible from SSL_get_verify_result().

	<li>Use the X509_STORE_CTX get_issuer() callback from the new X.509
	    verifier to fix hashed certificate directories.

	<li>Only check
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BIO_should_read.3">BIO_should_read(3)</a>
	    on read and
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BIO_should_write.3">BIO_should_write(3)</a>
	    on write.  Previously,
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BIO_should_write.3">BIO_should_write(3)</a>
	    was also checked after read and
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BIO_should_read.3">BIO_should_read(3)</a>
	    after write which could cause stalls in software that uses the same
	    BIO for read and write.

	<li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openssl.1">openssl(1)</a>
	    verify, also check for error on the store context since the return
	    value of
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/X509_verify_cert.3">X509_verify_cert(3)</a>
	    is unreliable in presence of a callback that returns 1 too often.

	<li>Handle additional certificate error cases in the new X.509 verifier.
	    Keep track of the errors encountered if a verify callback tells the
	    verifier to continue and report them back via the error on the store
	    context. This mimics the behavior of the old verifier that would
	    persist the first error encountered while building the chain.

	<li>Report specific failures for "self signed certificates" in a way
	    compatible with the old verifier since software relies on the
	    error code.

	<li>Plug a large memory leak in the new verifier caused by calling
	    X509_policy_check(3) repeatedly.

	<li>Avoid leaking memory in x509_verify_chain_dup().
    </ul>
  </ul>

<li>OpenSSH 8.5
  <ul>
    <li>Security fixes
    <ul>
	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>:
	fixed a double-free memory corruption that was introduced in OpenSSH
	8.2 . We treat all such memory faults as potentially exploitable. This
	bug could be reached by an attacker with access to the agent socket.<br>

	On modern operating systems where the OS can provide information
	about the user identity connected to a socket, OpenSSH ssh-agent and
	sshd limit agent socket access only to the originating user and root.
	Additional mitigation may be afforded by the system's
	malloc(3)/free(3) implementation, if it detects double-free
	conditions.<br>

	The most likely scenario for exploitation is a user forwarding an
	agent either to an account shared with a malicious user or to a host
	with an attacker holding root access.
    </ul>
    <li>Potentially incompatible changes
    <ul>
	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: this release
	changes the first-preference signature algorithm from ECDSA to
	ED25519.

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: set the TOS/DSCP
	specified in the configuration for interactive use prior to TCP
	connect. The connection phase of the SSH session is time-sensitive and
	often explicitly interactive.  The ultimate interactive/bulk TOS/DSCP
	will be set after authentication completes.

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: remove the
	pre-standardization cipher rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se. It is an alias
	for aes256-cbc before it was standardized in RFC4253 (2006), has been
	deprecated and disabled by default since OpenSSH 7.2 (2016) and was
	only briefly documented in ssh.1 in 2001.

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: update/replace the
	experimental post-quantum hybrid key exchange method based on
	Streamlined NTRU Prime coupled with X25519.<br>

	The previous sntrup4591761x25519-sha512@tinyssh.org method is
	replaced with sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com. Per its designers,
	the sntrup4591761 algorithm was superseded almost two years ago by
	sntrup761.
	(Note that both the updated method and the one that it replaced are
	disabled by default.)

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: disable
	CheckHostIP by default. It provides insignificant benefits while
	making key rotation significantly more difficult, especially for hosts
	behind IP-based load-balancers.
    </ul>
    <li>New Features
    <ul>
	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: this release
	enables UpdateHostkeys by default subject to some conservative
	preconditions:
	<ul>
	    <li>The key was matched in the UserKnownHostsFile (and not in the
	      GlobalKnownHostsFile).
	    <li>The same key does not exist under another name.
	    <li>A certificate host key is not in use.
	    <li>known_hosts contains no matching wildcard hostname pattern.
	    <li>VerifyHostKeyDNS is not enabled.
	    <li>The default UserKnownHostsFile is in use.
	</ul>
	We expect some of these conditions will be modified or relaxed in
	future.

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: add a new
	LogVerbose configuration directive for that allows forcing maximum
	debug logging by file/function/line pattern-lists.

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: when
	prompting the user to accept a new hostkey, display any other host
	names/addresses already associated with the key.

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: allow
	UserKnownHostsFile=none to indicate that no known_hosts file should be
	used to identify host keys.

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add a
	ssh_config KnownHostsCommand option that allows the client to obtain
	known_hosts data from a command in addition to the usual files.

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: add a
	ssh_config PermitRemoteOpen option that allows the client to restrict
	the destination when RemoteForward is used with SOCKS.

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: for FIDO
	keys, if a signature operation fails with a "incorrect PIN" reason and
	no PIN was initially requested from the user, then request a PIN and
	retry the operation. This supports some biometric devices that fall
	back to requiring PIN when reading of the biometric failed, and
	devices that require PINs for all hosted credentials.

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: implement
	client address-based rate-limiting via new <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>
	PerSourceMaxStartups and PerSourceNetBlockSize directives that provide
	more fine-grained control on a per-origin address basis than the
	global MaxStartups limit.
    </ul>
    <li>Bugfixes
    <ul>
	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: Prefix
	keyboard interactive prompts with "(user@host)" to make it easier to
	determine which connection they are associated with in cases like scp
	-3, ProxyJump, etc. bz#3224

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix
	sshd_config SetEnv directives located inside Match blocks. GHPR#201

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: when
	requesting a FIDO token touch on stderr, inform the user once the
	touch has been recorded.

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: prevent
	integer overflow when ridiculously large ConnectTimeout values are
	specified, capping the effective value (for most platforms) at 24
	days. bz#3229

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: consider the
	ECDSA key subtype when ordering host key algorithms in the client.

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: rename the
	PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes keyword to PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms. The
	previous name incorrectly suggested that it control allowed key
	algorithms, when this option actually specifies the signature
	algorithms that are accepted. The previous name remains available as
	an alias. bz#3253

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: similarly, rename
	HostbasedKeyTypes (ssh) and HostbasedAcceptedKeyTypes (sshd) to
	HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms.

	<li><a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8">sftp-server(8)</a>: add
	missing lsetstat@openssh.com documentation and advertisement in the
	server's SSH2_FXP_VERSION hello packet.

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: more strictly
	enforce KEX state-machine by banning packet types once they are
	received. Fixes memleak caused by duplicate
	SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REQUEST (oss-fuzz #30078).

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: allow the
	full range of UIDs/GIDs for chown/chgrp on 32bit platforms instead of
	being limited by LONG_MAX. bz#3206

	<li>Minor man page fixes (capitalization, commas, etc.) bz#3223

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: when doing
	an sftp recursive upload or download of a read-only directory, ensure
	that the directory is created with write and execute permissions in
	the interim so that the transfer can actually complete, then set the
	directory permission as the final step. bz#3222

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
	document the -Z, check the validity of its argument earlier and
	provide a better error message if it's not correct.  bz#2879

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: ignore
	comments at the end of config lines in ssh_config, similar to what we
	already do for sshd_config. bz#2320

	<li><a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5">sshd_config(5)</a>:
	mention that DisableForwarding is valid in a sshd_config Match block.
	bz3239

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>: fix
	incorrect sorting of "ls -ltr" under some circumstances. bz3248.

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>: fix potential
	integer truncation of (unlikely) timeout values. bz#3250

	<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>: make
	hostbased authentication send the signature algorithm in its
	SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST packets instead of the key type.  This make
	HostbasedAcceptedAlgorithms do what it is supposed to - filter on
	signature algorithm and not key type.

If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install69.iso</i> or
<i>cd69.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install69.img</i> or
<i>miniroot69.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included
INSTALL.amd64 document.

<p>
If you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.amd64.

<h3>OpenBSD/arm64:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>install69.img</i> or <i>miniroot69.img</i> to a disk and boot from it
after connecting to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.arm64 for more
details.

<h3>OpenBSD/armv7:</h3>

<p>
Write a system specific miniroot to an SD card and boot from it after connecting
to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.armv7 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/hppa:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network by following the instructions in INSTALL.hppa or the
<a href="hppa.html#install">hppa platform page</a>.

<h3>OpenBSD/i386:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install69.iso</i> or
<i>cd69.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install69.img</i> or
<i>miniroot69.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in
the included INSTALL.i386 document.

<p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.i386.

<h3>OpenBSD/landisk:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot69.img</i> to the start of the CF
or disk, and boot normally.

<h3>OpenBSD/loongson:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot69.img</i> to a USB stick and boot bsd.rd from it
or boot bsd.rd via tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.loongson for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/luna88k:</h3>

<p>
Copy 'boot' and 'bsd.rd' to a Mach or UniOS partition, and boot the bootloader
from the PROM, and then bsd.rd from the bootloader.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.luna88k for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, and power on your machine
while holding down the <i>C</i> key until the display turns on and
shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/6.9/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

<h3>OpenBSD/octeon:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, boot bsd.rd over the network via DHCP/tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.octeon for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/powerpc64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install69.img</i> or <i>miniroot69.img</i> to a
USB stick, plug it into the machine and choose the <i>OpenBSD
install</i> menu item in Petitboot.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.powerpc64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sgi:</h3>

<p>
To install, burn cd69.iso on a CD-R, put it in the CD drive of your
machine and select <i>Install System Software</i> from the System Maintenance
menu. Indigo/Indy/Indigo2 (R4000) systems will not boot automatically from
CD-ROM, and need a proper invocation from the PROM prompt.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.sgi for more details.

<p>
If your machine doesn't have a CD drive, you can setup a DHCP/tftp network
server, and boot using "bootp()/bsd.rd.IP##" using the kernel matching your
system type. Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.sgi for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy69.img</i> or <i>floppyB69.img</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>miniroot69.img</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 6.8 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade69.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.
</section>

<section id=sourcecode>
<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.

<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr/ports</kbd>
# <kbd>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_6_9</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 6.9 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
