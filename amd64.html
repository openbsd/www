<p>
OpenBSD/amd64 runs on AMD's Athlon-64 family of processors in 64-bit mode.
It also runs on processors made by other manufacturers which have cloned
the AMD64 extensions.

<p>
Note that <a href="i386.html">OpenBSD/i386</a> also runs on these
processors, but in 32-bit mode.

<p>
X Window System support is available for most graphics cards, using
the X.Org server.  As with other free operating systems it is highly recommended
that Nvidia cards are avoided since this vendor continues to show tremendous
resistance towards releasing information that would allow X.Org to support their
hardware properly.

<h3 id="status"><strong>Current status:</strong></h3>

<p>
The only major shortcoming at this time is that the kernel debugger
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/amd64/ddb.4">ddb</a>
is somewhat poor.

<h3 id="hardware"><strong>Supported hardware:</strong></h3>

<h4>Processors</h4>

<p>
All versions of the AMD Athlon 64 processors and their clones are
supported.

<h4>Graphics Support</h4>

<p>
Basic graphics support should support most hardware, but some features like
video or 3D acceleration require additional driver support. Unsupported devices
will typically still work in VESA or EFIFB mode.
<p>
AMD devices use a confusing mix of code names and rebadging. Some devices
expected to work:
<ul>
<li>Products using "Northern Islands," "Southern Islands," or "Sea Islands"
    graphics cores.
<li>AMD Radeon 5000 series
<li>Earlier AMD and ATI models are expected to work as well.
</ul>
<p>
Intel devices can be confusing as well. Some devices expected to work:
<ul>
<li>Intel Kaby Lake (found on i-7xxx CPU)
<li>Intel Skylake (found on i-6xxx CPU)
<li>Intel Broadwell (found on i-5xxx CPU)
<li>Intel Broxton/Apollo Lake
<li>Intel Amber Lake
<li>Intel Gemini Lake
<li>Intel Coffee Lake
<li>Intel Whiskey Lake
<!-- XXX: uncomment if/when hardware becomes available
<li>Intel Cannon Lake
<li>Intel Ice Lake
-->
<li>Earlier Intel models and revisions are expected to work as well.
<li>The PowerVR graphics found on some Atom CPUs are not supported.
</ul>

<h3>Unsupported Hardware:</h3>

<p>
New hardware is constantly being released, some of which may lack support.
Your <a href="donations.html">donation of time, hardware, or documentation</a>
can accelerate this support!

<strong>Getting and installing OpenBSD/amd64:</strong>
</h3>

<p>
The latest supported OpenBSD/amd64 release is
<a href="66.html">OpenBSD 6.6</a>.
Here are the
<a href="https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.6/amd64/INSTALL.amd64">
OpenBSD/amd64 installation instructions</a>.

<p>
Snapshots are made available from time to time, in
<a href="https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/amd64">this location</a>
as well as on a few
<a href="ftp.html">mirrors</a>.
Here are the
<a href="https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/amd64/INSTALL.amd64">
OpenBSD/amd64 snapshot installation instructions</a> as well.

<p>
There are several installation media provided:
<ul>
  <li><strong>CD image</strong> (installXX.iso)
  <br>
  The CD ISO provides an <i>El Torito</i> no-emulation boot image
  that includes almost all OpenBSD drivers.
  This also includes minimal USB support (storage devices and keyboard).<br>
  For the latest list of drivers available on this image, take a look at the
  <a href="https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/src/sys/arch/amd64/conf/RAMDISK_CD?rev=HEAD">RAMDISK_CD</a>
  kernel configuration file.
  <li><strong>Disk image</strong> (minirootXX.fs)
  <br>
  The same installer as the CD ISO, but in a form suitable for creating bootable
  hard drives or USB flash drives.
  <li><strong>Floppy A</strong> (floppyXX.fs)
  <br>
  This 1.44MB floppy image contains the most common drivers.
  It is designed to cover the most typical PC. As a general rule, you will
  find that the missing drivers are ones which need large microcodes to run,
  such as for rare SCSI cards, gigabit ethernet cards, or RAID devices.<br>
  For the latest list of drivers available on this image, take a look at the
  <a href="https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/src/sys/arch/amd64/conf/RAMDISK?rev=HEAD">RAMDISK</a>
  kernel configuration file.
</ul>
