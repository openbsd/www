2.6 Changelog
</h2>
<hr>

<p>
This is a partial list of the major machine independent changes
(i.e., these are the changes people ask about most often).  Machine
specific changes have also been made, and are sometimes mentioned
in the pages for the specific <a href=plat.html>platforms</a> if you
are interested in further port-specific details.  Many ports
have had architecture-specific enhancements relative to NetBSD,
but when they do not they certainly have plenty of platform-independent
changes, starting with those listed below..
