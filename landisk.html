<p>
OpenBSD/landisk runs on machines related to the
<a href="http://www.iodata.jp/prod/storage/hdd/2004/usl-5p/index.htm">
IO-DATA USL-5P</a>, using a
<a href="http://www.renesas.com">Hitachi/Renesas</a>
SH-4 CPU.<br>
This platform comes in a variety of models:

<ul>
<li>IO-DATA USL-5P, using CF storage (Japan; as shown)
<li>IO-DATA HDL-U, HDL-AV, HDL-W and HDLM-U series (Japan)
<li>SuperTank LAN Tank (SOTO-HDLWU) (Japan)
<li>IO-DATA UHDL-160U and UHDL-300U (May be found in USA)
<li>Plextor PX-EH16L, PX-EH25L and PX-EH40L
</ul>

<p>
Note: The "Giga-landisk" and HDL-F machines are ARM-based
(both Intel XScale &amp; Marvell), some of which were supported by the
defunct <a href="armish.html">armish</a> architecture.

<h3 id="history"><strong>History</strong></h3>

<p>
OpenBSD/landisk is the 1st OpenBSD port to a
<a href="http://www.renesas.com">Hitachi/Renesas</a> SH-4 based machine.
It is hoped that other SH-4 based machines will show up which are
interesting enough for our user and development community, but the SH-4
processor is normally used only in true embedded products.

<p>
This processor architecture is the first 32-bit successor of a series
of extremely bizarre 8 and 16 bit processors by Hitachi.  It has a
very strange instruction set and MMU, and developers find it quite a
challenge to map their knowledge of Unix low-level ideas to the
processor architecture.

<h3 id="status"><strong>Current status</strong></h3>

<p>
Hardware support is mostly complete and quite stable.

<p>
The latest supported OpenBSD/landisk release is
<a href="77.html">OpenBSD 7.7</a>.

<strong>Serial cable connection</strong>
</h3>
All of these machines require a special serial cable which does
voltage conversion, and can hopefully be purchased along with the
card.  This cable normally contains a little max232 or similar chip
which converts from the 3.3V signals to +/-12V.  The IO-DATA cable
has pins which can grip the inside of the holes.  Or you can attempt
to build your own using
<a href="http://www.mizore.jp/wiki/index.php?LANDISK%2Fserial-console">
some Japanese instructions</a>.

<p>
The IO-DATA cable converts from a DB9 connector to a 5-pin header
(3.3V Tx Rx GND NC).  Note that the Rx and Tx pins on the board are
<b>swapped</b> compared to the ARM-based machines made by IO-DATA.
All the board models have a 5-pin connector (called CN7) which the cable
can plug into -- except for the USL-5P which has a 4-pin header (thus
requiring removal of the spare pin).

<p>
A USL-5P is shown with a modified IO-DATA cable.  In this case the cable
has been shortened significantly and the DB9 connector is glued into a slot
carefully cut into the plastic between the ethernet and a USB port.
