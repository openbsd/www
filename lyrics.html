Release Songs
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
Every 6 months the OpenBSD project has the pleasure to release
our software with artwork and a matching song.
Theo and some other developers mutate a theme (from a classical
setting, a movie, or some genre) into the fishy world of Puffy, to
describe some advance, event or controversy the project went through
over the previous six months. To match the art released with the
historical CD sets, we joined up with some musicians we know to make
at least one song.

<td class=lyrics>
<p>
Once there was a Wizard so old and wise<br>
that he asked Mother Night for a new enterprise<br>
falling asleep his wish was heard<br>
and by Merlin's beard<br>
what a strange world he entered<br>
<br>
In this world existed only zeros and ones<br>
never had a Wizard seen such duality, not once<br>
He approached one of the zeros and said<br>
<i>Who are you?</i><br>
<i>I'm a zero</i><br>
<i>yes, I see, but what do you do?</i><br>
The zero said<br>
<i>I am the beginning and the end</i><br>
<br>
Never had our Wizard met such a strange friend<br>
He did not understand at all what he saw<br>
and walking on this time met another strange fella<br>
he approached the one and said:<br>
<i>Who are you?</i><br>
<i>I'm One</i><br>
<i>Yes, I see, but what do you do?</i><br>
The one said: <i>I am everything in between</i><br>
<br>
The Wizard could not believe what his eyes had just seen<br>
He sat down on a stone feeling tired and alone<br>
missing his friends in the binary unknown<br>
silent and sad he played with his beard<br>
suddenly, a little fish appeared!<br>
<br>
The Wizard said: <i>you are not a zero or a one?</i><br>
<i>No, I'm a fish, come swim with me, come</i><br>
They swam together and dived<br>
deep into the ocean<br>
until they found the place<br>
where it once all began<br>
<br>
The little fish took a small rake and starting raking the sand<br>
and the Wizard was amazed by the waves of this new friend<br>
he said<br>
<i>Little fish, who are you?</i><br>
<i>I'm a gardener, don't you see?</i><br>
<i>Well, yes, but what do you do?</i><br>
The little fish - without stopping - calmly made clear<br>
<i>My task is important, this is what I do here,<br>
the sand contains crucial information<br>
which I need to order<br>
before the rising of the sun.</i><br>
<br>
Suddenly, from far, a big whale appeared<br>
The Wizard, frightend, quickly hid behind his beard<br>
The whale opened his mouth<br>
but instead of swallowing our friend<br>
released from his tongue<br>
piles and piles of new sand.<br>
The Wizard, startled, opened his mouth<br>
but the fish said<br>
<i>No no no, no questions allowed,<br>
we do not need to know where he comes from or goes<br>
for a little mystery is what gives us purpose.</i><br>
<br>
Finally something the Wizard could understand<br>
he had found the mystery underneath the beginning and the end<br>
he had dived way below everything in between<br>
and saw the biggest whale he had ever seen<br>
<br>
He said <i>My dear fish, what you do, I can see,<br>
is raking the maritime soil of mystery<br>
from now on, I will protect you, your sand, and your shells,<br>
coming back every year to update my spells.</i><br>
<br>
They said their goodbyes<br>
and the Wizard returned<br>
to his nice and warm bed,<br>
with all his lessons learned<br>
He was happy that he now understood this strange place<br>
and could protect his new friends for the rest of his days<br>

There we see developers, busy as bees.<br>
They plan and polish one KNF after another.<br>
Each carefully tending to their trees.<br>
Leaving directories better than they found them.<br>
<br>
The group shares common norms for style and aesthetics.<br>
Indentation is a brisk 8 character tab.<br>
Four spaces are used for the second level.<br>
All code fits in 80 columns.<br>
Only tabs followed by spaces are used to form the indentation.<br>
Looking at the source sideways, this makes for a magnificent skyline.<br>
<br>
Punctilious and meticulous attention to detail.<br>
Major structures are declared at the top of the file in which they are used.<br>
Each variable declaration its own line.<br>
Except in functions, where multiple ones per line are okay.<br>
A cheerful tab after the first word.<br>
Variables are sorted by use, then by size, then by alphabetical order.<br>
Each and every trailing whitespace buffed away.<br>
<br>
Important comments can be recognized by their sheer size: a single sentence<br>
is allowed to occupy three whole lines by spreading its starry lines!<br>
All major routines have a comment briefly describing what they do.<br>
The comment before the "main" routine describes what the program does.<br>
Usage statements take the same form as the synopsis in manual pages.<br>
Of course, manual pages are this masterpiece's crown jewels.<br>

Like the movie "Hackers", the OpenBSD project is now 25 years old.
Though the movie played no part in our focus on security.
<p>
What a ride it's been.
<p>
My little hobby project took itself both too seriously, and not
seriously at all.  Then somewhere along the way the project started
collecting many seriously skilled developers who found it a
"fertile ground" to play and experiment. (To counter that, maybe they
didn't find other places as interesting, or didn't want to write
independent software which wasn't being adopted).
<p>
The "fertile ground" I'm talking about is our willingness to throw away
the old and replace it, or try to adopt or build security protections,
or integrate pieces normally not part of a unix system (such as the
extensive network components).  The OpenSSH story comes from the same
approach.
<p>
In doing so, we didn't annoy too many people because we stayed true to
the spirit of old BSD unix.  It <i>feels</i> like modernized SunOS 4.0,
trying to be a highly cohesive complete system where all the parts are
supposed to work similarly, and if they don't, we consider changing them.
The ifconfig command has been extended greatly, but it remains :-)
<p>
Strangely, along the way our work started influencing the whole
software industry.  The packet filter pf is included in some systems.
Our libc work is in other places.  OpenSSH, privsep, and W^X and
address space randomization and other hardenings are either ubiquitous
now or inching that way.  Pieces of our work are in nooks and crannies
everywhere, while the cohesive whole OpenBSD continues to be developed
apace.
<p>
Another 25 years?

This software is free,<br>

Just read the code if unsure.<br>

What's the deal, what's still real?<br>
Ground yourself with truth.<br>
Run a software that allows you to sleuth.<br>

<p>
In OpenBSD developer circles few memes carry as strongly as "The 3
line diff".  This is a humorous warning, but also a true story.  More
than half the developers ("the new kids") don't know this story but
still repeat the meme &mdash; it has nearly become apocrypha.
<p>
Unfortunately, in software development not all problems are as trivial
as we think.
<p>
The event happened at a hackathon in Portugal more than a decade ago.
<p>
In a eureka moment Art declared he had found a stunningly simple
solution for a problem long pondered, and he could fix it in 2 &mdash; no
&mdash; 3 lines.  In the following weeks his change grew larger and larger,
introducing (or exposing) other problems.  We stood and stared.  It
was far from a 3 line diff, and was eventually discarded.
<p>
I am not writing words of mockery here.  This is a common occurrence in
complex software development.  To do great things, we must reach for
the sky.  Sometimes we fail, and quite often it is messy.
<p>
There is of course a danger we'll believe we are invincible, and push
a change which is too disruptive to others.  For that reason, we
operate as a team.  We can try to avoid hubris.
<p>
Therefore to this day posing a question like "And you can fix the
problem in 3 lines?" is a humorous way of keeping each other honest.
</div>

<td class=lyrics>
<p>
Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale,<br>
A tale of a fateful diff,<br>
That started on a set of stairs<br>
Right by a pizza joint.<br>
<p>
Art was a mighty coding man,<br>
And he was mighty sure<br>
The only change that was required<br>
Was a three-line diff, a three-line diff.<br>
<p>
The coding started getting tough,<br>
The change began to swell,<br>
Despite the confidence of the programmers<br>
The system would then crash,<br>
the system always crashed.<br>
<p>
The simple change became complex<br>
Just too many things overlooked,<br>
With Grabowski,<br>
And the testers too,  <br>
Theo watching and skeptical<br>
Miod Vallat,<br>
And Kettenis, and Dale, and...<br>
Hacking Grabowski's diff.<br>
<p>
So this is a tale of our programmers,<br>
They've been here for 20 years.<br>
They'll have to do the best they can,<br>
It's an endless task.<br>
<p>
Grabowski and the others too<br>
Will do their very best<br>
To get the changes into prod<br>
It is an epic slog,<br>
<p>
No QEMU, only DDB,<br>
Not a single luxury,<br>
Like Ritchie and Thompson did<br>
It's as primitive as can be<br>
<p>
So check a new diff every week,<br>
Your head is sure to hurt<br>
While all the puzzled programmers<br>
Gawk at Grabowski's diff<br>
<p>
Working on a marginal diff.<br>

<p>
OpenBSD was only a few months old when
we realized that read-only repository access
for everyone was a critical concept.
<p>
Previously, open source projects would make
occasional releases accompanied by tarballs of
final source files and Changelogs files, but would
not expose the step-by-step changes of the
development process.  Unwittingly all open source
projects were operating with a walled garden
approach.
<p>
Chuck Cranor and I worked on the anoncvs feature, and
Bob Beck soon became involved in moving the anoncvs
mirror off my overloaded ISDN network to the
University of Alberta, thereby increasing our capacity
to deliver.  Nowadays there are many anoncvs mirrors.
<p>
The introduction of anoncvs meant people without commit
access could read the commit logs, as well as each
committed diff.  They could reason about the past as
they proposed new changes.
<p>
Anoncvs had an immediate impact expanding our development
group. We were inundated with high quality diffs.  These
outsider developers wrote excellent changes because they had
sufficient context to reason upon.  Those who overwhelmed us
with good changes became developers with commit access.  We
were forced to hand out commit accounts like candy.
<p>
Some people said we would never last.  Their cynicism
could almost be thanked for the increase in openness
we embraced, and then our openness probably led others
to embrace it also.
</div>

<td class=lyrics>
<p>
I had a Type-4 keyboard,<br>
Bought with my Sun workstation,<br>
Hacked on it 'til my fingers bled.<br>
Was the winter of '95.<br>
<p>
Me and the guys from core,<br>
Had a source tree with lots of history.<br>
Chris and Charles held a little coup,<br>
I should have known I'd lose my history.<br>
<p>
Oh, when I look back now,<br>
I can see we all have nothing<br>
When it all can be...
when it can be taken away.<br>
Everyone needs to know their history.<br>
It was the winter of '95<br>
<p>
So we carried on with a fresh source tree,<br>
Spent all of our hours coding,<br>
Making changes in our private history,<br>
Repeating the error of the past, yeah.<br>
<p>
The source tree just got too big,<br>
Too many diffs, too unreliable,<br>
Too few people had any access;<br>
Got to open it up now and forever<br>
Everyone needs to see the history.<br>
<p>
Sometimes when I look for something<br>
Reading ancient tarballs with despair<br>
I wonder what they were thinking.<br>
<p>
And now the times have changed<br>
Repos on the web, git,<br>
now githubs everywhere.<br>
not like the winter of '95<br>
<p>
Back around that Halloween,<br>
Microsoft said open source would never last,<br>
But now they use the repo tools,<br>
In the same open access way.<br>
<p>
Everyone needs to see the history.<br>

In 20 years of mitigating security issues, we've encountered plenty of
resistance. Some upstream projects don't seem to care that their
software follows unsafe practices or sacrifice security in favor of
obsolete methods.  It takes sustained pressure to tear down the walls.

Our developers don't really promise an ideal world where all attackers
are blocked all the time.  But our small group developed some
components that help make a difference.
</div>

<td class=lyrics>
<p>
Black Hat, out there in the cold<br>
Hacking websites for control<br>
Can you crack me?<br>
Black Hat, working for the Chinese<br>
With twitchy fingers on flashing keys<br>
Can you spoof me?<br>
Black Hat, don't let them put you in the light<br>
Never give in: just fight!<br>
<p>
Black Hat, always trying to p0wn,<br>
Social engineering with a phone,<br>
Can you phish me?<br>
Black Hat, with your buffer overflows<br>
Waiting for someone to hit one<br>
Can you probe me?<br>
Black Hat, do you do this for pure knowledge?<br>
They opened the file! Too bad: they're pledged<br>
<p>
But it was all futility<br>
The firewall was strong<br>
As all can see<br>
No matter how he tried<br>
He could not break free()<br>
And his worm just sputtered and died<br>
<p>
Black Hat, skimming cards down at the bank<br>
always claiming "it was just a prank!"<br>
Can you scam me?<br>
Black Hat, out there on the net<br>
Throwing packets with wget<br>
Can you hack me?<br>
Black Hat, have you no hope at all?<br>
The firewalls were carped: they never fall<br>

Consider donating to our development efforts via
<a href="https://www.openbsdfoundation.org">the OpenBSD Foundation</a>.
This Canadian not-for-profit funds OpenBSD's efforts which happen in
Canada and all over the world.
<p>
Majority of the funds covers the <a href="hackathons.html">hackathons</a>,
which increase collaboration between developers by getting them face to
face regularly.
<p>
Funding OpenBSD is funding innovation.

Money, donate your pay.<br>
Automate with a cron job and we'll be ok.<br>
Money, donate your pay.<br>
Thoughtful programming versus "just make it fast".<br>
TLB that cache with high CPU and cause a thrash.<br>
Single cores are out, SMP unlocking<br>
Will get you a faster net stream<br>
<p>
Canaries have your back.<br>
In the right place, hacks stop in your protected stack.<br>
Puffy, he's a hit.<br>
Theo doesn't suffer users' ill-informed bullshit.<br>
Fly to hackathons, sleep in dormatory beds<br>
Worldwide userbase, can you fund our project?<br>
<p>
Not donating, it's a crime.<br>
Distributed and shared fairly but can't exist on just a dime. <br>
OpenBSD, so they say<br>
Is the securest system today<br>
Don't make us busk until dusk 'cause we'd rather be hacking away<br>

<p>
As developers, we want to see users succeed, and so it's especially
frustrating to see users setting themselves up to fail.
<p>
The necessity of triaging vague complaints to determine if they
represent true bugs or user error is a tax on all the users whose mail
goes unread when motivation runs out. Much like a fork bomb process,
these low content threads multiply and explode, threatening the
stability of the system itself and aggravating admins and users alike.

<div class=commentary>
<p>
As the author of a number of the OpenBSD songs, I'll admit that
sometimes it's a bit of a chore. Theo bugs me to help him out, often
with a theme, and eventually I relent and devote an evening to it.
<p>
One of the things that we're passionate about is making changes to the
software ecosystem that make things safer for all of us - not just
OpenBSD. Very often we try techniques, and adopt practices on OpenBSD
to make things better across the ecosystem, and hope to encourage
others to follow our lead.
<p>
We've had a lot of great success upstreaming changes and ideas to
individual projects, often through the diligent work of the OpenBSD
ports developers.  We've had less success promoting things up through
standards bodies and other projects.  Too often the world seems caught
up in a seemingly suicidal "backward compatibility forever" fervor,
exacerbated by standards bodies populated by corporate representation
that does not want to make any kinds of disruptive changes that might
cause expense.
<p>
This time, once Theo put the bug in my ear, it didn't take me very
long.  I pondered our recent efforts to fix random functions via
standards bodies, and considered the real possibility of my being
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081847/https://lwn.net/Articles/563285/">
harmed by the failure of an embedded 32 bit linux device in 2038</a>,
and then this song just wrote itself in about 10 minutes.
<p>
Enjoy

Mother, don't you want to change this code?<br>
Mother, don't you think this cruft's too old?<br>
Mother, do you think we're heading for a fall?<br>
Ooooh aah, mother, we should change these calls.<br>
<p>
Mother, should I send a patch upstream?<br>
Mother, do you think it'll change a thing?<br>
Mother, will they twist this in an unfair light?<br>
Ooooh aah, is it just a waste of time?<br>

Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry<br>
Mama's gonna keep all of her customers true<br>
Mama's gonna keep legacy crap there with you<br>
Mama's gonna keep changes from making them sad<br>
She won't let you flense but she might let you add<br>
Mama's gonna keep baby growing much more<br>

Ooooh, babe, ooooh, babe, ooooh, babe<br>
Of course Mama's gonna help add some calls<br>

Mother, do you think this code is stuffed?  (with shit.....)<br>
Mother, do you think it's dangerous? (a bit.....)<br>
Mother, can we tear this API apart?<br>
Oooh aah, mother, will you break my heart?<br>
<p>
Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry<br>
Mama's gonna rig all of the standards for you<br>
Mama won't let anything foreign get through<br>
Mama's gonna wait up till you send it, dear<br>
Mama will subvert things not invented here <br>
Mamma's gonna keep baby under control<br>

Ooooh, babe, ooooh, babe, ooooh, babe<br>
Don't say deprecation to me.<br>

<div class=commentary>
<p>
In Open Source philosophy, distinctions between progress or
backwards-compatibility, along with other dichotomous API judgments,
are vendor choice, not user; so, the duality of profit and control is
an indivisible whole. In the ethics of OpenBSD on the other hand, most
notably in the philosophy of Theo de Raadt (c. 21st century AD), a
moral dimension is attached to the idea of stagnation and advancement.

So,<br>
So you think you can sell<br>

ABIs cast in stone?<br>
Would you sell the green fields<br>

Be stable for a wage?<br>
So you think you can sell<br>
<p>
Did you decide to trade<br>
Your leaders for stock?<br>
Complex code in the tree<br>
For simple code that was free?<br>
Cold cash for your clout?<br>
Did you walk out<br>
On a lead role in the war<br>
For a part as a boy scout?<br>
<p>
How I wish, how I wish you were secure<br>
We're just two old fish swimming in a toilet bowl,<br>
it's all so impure<br>
Fighting over the same APIs<br>
What do you prize?<br>
That same old lure<br>
Wish you were secure<br>

About a silly man who made a change<br>

<p>
BIO_snprintf with a cast..<br>
He didn't know the POSIX API had changed<br>
A crowd on slashdot stood and stared.<br>
They'd seen such code before<br>
Everyone was really sure<br>
It was from 1984..<br>
<p>
I saw a tweet today oh boy.<br>
The OpenBSD devs had just forked the code.<br>
And though the code was rather gross<br>
They held their nose and dove.<br>

We've done stuff about LibreSSL before, but this particular song just
fit with the release theme. While the lyrics can speak for themselves,
"A Year In The Life" is representative of more than just LibreSSL. The
pattern of LibreSSL development is a pattern that has repeated itself
many times in OpenBSD &mdash; a decision is made by a few people to do
something, followed by action, and letting the world share it if they
like it (such as with OpenSSH). To the developers actually doing the
work, reactions to such efforts can often seem surreal, or
irrelevant. The juxtaposition of working on the very real with the
surreal going on around you can often make working on such projects
feel like you're in a bit of an altered reality..  Sort of like the
song. A number of us have had many years like this in the last 20.

No one <em>wants</em> to fork an open source project: it's a huge
amount of work and isn't efficient in community time, but when you
wake up one day and find that a hole in the SSL library you're using
made world-wide news, and that the library's bad code style is
hiding exploit mitigation countermeasures, then suddenly forking
seems critically important.  Two months of intense development later,
LibreSSL was released.
<p>
The bigger questions remain for the open source development community
to answer: why did this occur?  Why is the OpenSSL code base so hard
to understand?  Complexity is the enemy of security, so for something
whose raison d'&ecirc;tre is security, why are secondary goals allowed
to endanger the absolute #1 goal?  Or has OpenSSL become a brand which
allows companies to &mdash; on the cheap &mdash; meet security
"requirements" like FIPS instead of actually being secure?
<p>
How important is it for developers and customers to have software
where security is the goal?  How much are they willing to push back
on the OS developers and others to achieve that?  Can we set a new,
higher bar for best practices that will drive everyone to do more
than just posture?

In January of 2038, 32-bit Unix time will overflow and wrap
back to 1901.  This is known as the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">Year 2038 problem</a>.
POSIX operating systems have made strong inroads into embedded
roles, so this is anticipated to be substantially worse than the Y2K transition.
<p>
In August of 2012, Philip Guenther started the OpenBSD work to
solve this.
After a year of work it was ready enough for merging, and in August 2013
the <b>time_t</b> type was changed to int64_t on all
platforms and the kernel and userland were adapted to the new
situation. The initial work was committed right after OpenBSD 5.4,
then polished in tree over the next 6 months.
<p>
The next part of the process was to drag the "ports" software
ecosystem along because no one else had paved the way for 32-bit
machines to run with 64-bit <b>time_t</b>.  This required a fair
bit of upstream involvement. Thousands of fixes were required to
make both 32-bit and 64-bit time work transparently.  There will
be more fixing in the future, but the concept is proven.
<p>
In the past OpenBSD pushed risky theoretical ideas into mainstream
software practice by proving the ecosystem was ready to change.
No OS wants to make a ABI jump until the case for change is proven.
Stack protection, ASLR, and W^X principles are now in common use
by mainline operating systems... because things like Firefox
and Postgresql don't break anymore.  OpenBSD built that route.
<p>
In the same way, the road is paved for the 64-bit <b>time_t</b>
transition. Other operating systems can now make this jump.

Just as the original song professed its love for Brazil, "World,
you'll love my Linux" is the passionate call of an idealistic dreamer
who can't bear the thought of software that will only run under
Windows, and yet loves the situation with software that will only run
under particular Linux distributions.
<p>
This problem has proliferated itself into the standards bodies, with
Posix adopting Linuxisms ahead of any other variant of Unix.
<p>
Posix and Unix have made it where you can write reasonably portable
software and have it compile and run across a multitude of platforms.
Now this seems to be changing as the love for Linux drives the
standards bodies into accepting everything Linux, good and bad.
<p>
We also are faced with groups writing software that only works
with particular distributions of Linux. From this we get software that
not only isn't very portable, but often not particularly stable. Our
idealistic dreamer in the song loves running one, or more than one distribution
of Linux for a particular purpose. Unfortunately, the rest of us are left
with the unattractive choice of doing the same, or relying on
herculean efforts to port software that is being actively developed in a
way to discourage porting it to other platforms.
</div>

<td class=lyrics>
<p>
Linux, the one and only true Unix<br>
We are in every way Posix<br>
We voice our yearning "Someday soon"<br>
We won't need any other.<br>
<p>
Then, tomorrow brings a new distro<br>
It's better than the last you know<br>
Another million bits that changed<br>
All the hacks and tweaks we conjure up<br>
They just get pushed into Posix<br>
There's one thing that I know<br>
The world will love it, all Linux<br>
<p>
Then, there's other stuff we push as well<br>
Others can work around this hell<br>
With just a million lines of Shell<br>
Now, as standards ape the one Linux<br>
Everyone else just gets stuffed<br>
There's one thing that I'm certain of<br>
The world will love it, all Linux<br>
We are Posix<br>
World, you'll love my Linux<br>
Linux, Linux<br>

<p>
This release is OpenBSD 4.9.  Then why is
the song about 4.2?  Huh?
<p>
The <a href="#44">OpenBSD 4.4 release artwork</a> honoured
the (Berkeley) CSRG guys for their efforts with the BSD 4.4
release &mdash; they fought and managed to free the code.
<p>
This release the artwork is based on the stories of Douglas Adams,
including his favorite number &mdash; 42.  Therefore we can remember
the previous major achievement of CSRG &mdash; BSD 4.2.
<p>
BSD 4.2 was
not free, but it created and integrated so many new
technologies that we all depend on today. Take a moment
to consider how many things first available in BSD 4.2 you are using
at this moment, to read this page &mdash; sockets, AF_INET,
virtual memory, etc.
<p>
Today, new releases of operating systems from well-known vendors
contain less new features than BSD 4.2 did.
<p>
If only we could stop slacking and make a release like that!

<p>
How many streams must a fish swim down<br>
before you can call him a man?<br>
And how many codes must a vendor lock down<br>
before silicon turns to sand?<br>
Yes and how many times must the lawyers fly<br>
before they are forever banned?<br>
<p>
The answer my friend<br>
BSD 4.2<br>
The answer<br>
BSD 4.2<br>
<p>
How many years can a planet exist<br>
before it is paved by the V?<br>
How many years can some source code exist<br>
before it's allowed to be free?<br>
Yes and how many times can a fish turn his head<br>
and pretend that he just doesn't see?<br>
<p>
The answer my friend<br>
BSD 4.2<br>
The answer<br>
BSD 4.2<br>
<p>
How many times must we fight for the right<br>
to share what is already ours?<br>
Yes and how many times must we hitch while we hike<br>
To end up not getting far?<br>
And how many fish must we shove in our ear<br>
before we can hear every star?<br>
<p>
The answer my friend<br>
BSD 4.2<br>
The answer<br>
BSD 4.2<br>
<p>
And now we can travel the galaxy<br>
with ships that are silicon made<br>
And now with a towel and a laptop in hand<br>
our future is made in the shade<br>
And what did we use to build on and on<br>
Inside everything that we use?<br>
<p>
The answer my friend<br>
BSD 4.2<br>
The answer<br>
BSD 4.2<br>

<p>
Back when I was twenty<br>
They said I wouldn't last<br>
All that I believed in<br>
Were the teachings of the past<br>
<p>
All I ever wanted<br>
Was to keep the world secure<br>
And all the criticizing<br>
Was something I'd endure<br>
<p>
The changes that I've been through<br>
And the trials along the way<br>
The battle isn't over<br>
And I'm living day by day<br>
<p>
But I'm still here<br>
<p>
Some say that I'm a hero<br>
But I'm just being me<br>
With my filter I can hide<br>
My true identity<br>
<p>
One day when I was flying<br>
Across the open skies<br>
I saw the bridge to freedom<br>
Had been weakened over time<br>
<p>
The server room was burning up<br>
And melting the array<br>
A little breath of cold air<br>
Was enough to save the day<br>
<p>
CHORUS:<br>
But I'm still here<br>
Better than I've ever been before<br>
I'm still free<br>
Close a window, open up a door<br>
I'm still me<br>
<p>
INSTRUMENTAL
<p>
Now that I am older<br>
And I've been around so long<br>
The world is ever changing<br>
I'm still righting all the wrong<br>

<p>
Nearly 10 years ago Kirk McKusick wrote a history of
the Berkeley Unix distributions for the
O'Reilly book "Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution".
We recommend you read his story, entitled
<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/kirkmck.html">
"Twenty Years of Berkeley Unix
From AT&T-Owned to Freely Redistributable"</a>
first, to see how Kirk remembers how we got here.
Sadly, since it showed up in book form originally, this text has
probably not been read by enough people.
<p>
The USL(AT&T) vs BSDI/UCB court case settlement documents were
not public until recently; their disclosure has made the facts more clear.
But the story of how three people decided to free the BSD codebase
of corporate pollution &mdash; and release it freely &mdash; is more interesting
than the lawsuit which followed.  Sure, a stupid lawsuit happened which
hindered the acceptance of the BSD code during a critical period.
But how did a bunch of guys go through the effort of replacing so
much AT&T code in the first place? After all, companies had
lots of really evil lawyers back then too &mdash; were they not afraid?
<p>
After a decade of development, most of the AT&T code had
already been replaced by university researchers and their associates.
So Keith Bostic, Mike Karels and Kirk McKusick (the main UCB CSRG group)
started going through the 4.3BSD codebase to cleanse the rest.
Keith, in particular, built a ragtag team (in those days, USENIX
conferences were a gold mine for such team building) and led these
rebels to rewrite and replace all the Imperial AT&T code, piece by
piece, starting with the libraries and userland programs.
Anyone who helped only got credit as a Contributor &mdash; people like
Chris Torek and a cast of .. hundreds more.
<p>
Then Mike and Kirk purified the kernel. After a bit more careful
checking, this led to the release of a clean tree called Net/2 which
was given to the world in June 1991 &mdash; the largest dump of free source
code the world had ever received (for those days &mdash; not modern monsters like OpenOffice).
<p>
Some of these ragtags formed a company (BSDi) to sell a production system
based on this free code base, and a year later Unix System Laboratories
(basically AT&T) sued BSDi and UCB.
Eventually AT&T lost and after a few trifling fixes (described in the
lawsuit documents) the codebase was free.  A few newer developments
(and more free code) were added, and released in June 1994 as 4.4BSD-Lite.
Just over 14 years later OpenBSD is releasing its own 4.4 release (and for
a lot less than $1000 per copy).
<p>
The OpenBSD 4.4 release is dedicated to Keith Bostic, Mike Karels, Kirk McKusick,
and all of those who contributed to making Net/2 and 4.4BSD-Lite free.

<p style="text-align: center">
Source Wars<br>
Episode IV<br>
Trial of the BSD Knights<br>
<p>
Not so very long ago<br>
and not so far away<br>
AT&T made system code<br>
and gave some bits away<br>
<p>
Some Berkeley geeks rebuilt it<br>
better, faster, more diverse<br>
This open thing was wonderful<br>
for everyone on Earth<br>
<p>
And then the roaring 90's came<br>
The Empire changed its mind<br>
And good old greed was back again<br>
The geeks were in a legal bind<br>
<p>
The Empire's Unix Lab<br>
sued BSDi from above<br>
The code is free but<br>
only we can sell it bub!<br>
<p>
The University came calling<br>
in full protective mode<br>
and proved the source in Net/2<br>
didn't use the Empire's code<br>
<p>
Then Bostic brought the Empire's books<br>
n' slammed them dandys down<br>
And showed the giant chunks<br>
of BSD code all around<br>
<p>
They didn't even give an ounce<br>
of credit front to back<br>
This broke the license USL<br>
was using to attack<br>
<p>
The case was thrown out by the judge<br>
and "settled" out of court<br>
And UCB was big enough<br>
to take it like a sport<br>
<p>
And to this day the geekfolk say<br>
Now did we win or lose?<br>
They shoulda made 'em reprint<br>
every book with proper dues<br>
<p>
And take out ads in major rags<br>
apologetically<br>
And maybe now it wouldn't be<br>
the same monopoly<br>
<p>
The Empire might have tumbled<br>
down if everybody saw<br>
How greed became so big<br>
they couldn't see that glaring flaw<br>
<p>
But only one community<br>
the one that makes it tick<br>
Is there to fight for everyone<br>
exposing hypocrites<br>
<p>
And OpenBSD is here<br>
to tell the story right<br>
Once again the fight is fought<br>
and kept in shining light<br>
<p>
And may the source be with you<br>
May the Empire fall apart<br>
Ya like that's gonna happen!<br>
But we gotta keep heart!<br>

<p>
We are just plain tired of being lectured to by a man
who is a lot like
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/08/campbell_grounded/">Naomi Campbell</a>.
<p>
In 1998 when a United Airlines plane was waiting in the queue at
Washington Dulles International Airport for take-off to New Orleans
(where a Usenix conference was taking place), one man stood up from
his seat, demanded that they stop waiting in the queue and be permitted
to deplane.  Even after orders from the crew and a pilot from
the cockpit he refused to sit down.  The plane exited the queue
and returned to the airport gangway.  Security personnel ran onto
the plane and removed this man, Richard Stallman, from the plane.
After Richard was removed from the plane, everyone else stayed
onboard and continued their journey to New Orleans.  A few
OpenBSD developers were on that same plane, seated very close by,
so we have an accurate story of the events.
<p>
This is the man who presumes that he should preach to us
about morality, freedom, and what is best for us.  He believes
it is his God-given role to tell us what is best for us, when he
has shown that he takes actions which are not best for everyone.
He prefers actions which he thinks are best for him &mdash; and him
alone &mdash; and then lies to the public.  Richard Stallman is no Spock.
<p>
We release our software in ways that are maximally free.  We
remove all restrictions on use and distribution, but leave a
requirement to be known as the authors.  We follow a pattern of
free source code distribution that started in the mid-1980's
in Berkeley, from before Richard Stallman had any powerful
influence which he could use so falsely.
<p>
We have a development sub-tree called "ports".  Our "ports" tree
builds software that is 'found on the net' into packages that
OpenBSD users can use more easily.  A scaffold of Makefiles and
scripts automatically fetch these pieces of software, apply
patches as required by OpenBSD, and then build them into nice
neat little tarballs.  This is provided as a convenience for
users. The ports tree is maintained by OpenBSD entirely separately
from our main source tree.  Some of the software which is fetched
and compiled is not as free as we would like, but what can we do.
All the other operating system projects make exactly the same
decision, and provide these same conveniences to their users.
<p>
Richard felt that this "ports tree" of ours made OpenBSD non-free.
He came to our mailing lists and lectured to us specifically, yet
he said nothing to the many other vendors who do the same; many of
them donate to the FSF and perhaps that has something to do with it.
Meanwhile, Richard has personally made sure that all the official
GNU software &mdash; including Emacs &mdash; compiles and runs on Windows.
<p>
That man is a false leader.  He is a hypocrite.  There may be some
people who listen to him.  But we don't listen to people who do not
follow their own stupid rules.

But for traders this is all you need"<br>

Rule zero came before this rule one<br>
Freedom means you cannot dictate to anyone"<br>

<p>
Those of us who work on OpenBSD are often asked why we do what we do.
This song's lyrics express the core motivations and goals which have
remained unchanged over the years &mdash; secure, free, reliable software,
that can be shared with anyone.  Many other projects purport to share
these same goals, and love to wrap themselves in a banner of "Open
Source" and "Free Software".  Given how many projects there are one
would think it might be easy to stick to those goals, but it doesn't
seem to work out that way.  A variety of desires drag many projects
away from the ideals very quickly.
<p>
Much of any operating system's usability depends on device support,
and there are some very tempting alternative ways to support devices
available to those who will surrender their moral code.  A project
could compromise by entering into NDA agreements with vendors, or
including binary objects in the operating system for which no source
code exists, or tying their users down with contract terms hidden
inside copyright notices.  All of these choices surrender some subset
of the ideals, and we simply will not do this.  Sure, we care about
getting devices working, but not at the expense of our original goals.
<p>
Of course since "free to share with anyone" is part of our goals,
we've been at the forefront of many licensing and NDA issues,
resulting in a good number of successes.  This success had led to much
recognition for the advancement of Free Software causes, but has also
led to other issues.
<p>
We fully admit that some BSD licensed software has been taken and used
by many commercial entities, but contributions come back more often
than people seem to know, and when they do, they're always still
properly attributed to the original authors, and given back in the
same spirit that they were given in the first place.
<p>
That's the best we can expect from companies.  After all, we make our
stuff so free so that everyone can benefit &mdash; it remains a core goal;
we really have not strayed at all in 10 years.  But we can expect more
from projects who talk about sharing &mdash; such as the various Linux
projects.
<p>
Now rather than seeing us as friends who can cooperatively improve all
codebases, we are seen as foes who oppose the GPL.  The participants
of "the race" are being manipulated by the FSF and their legal arm, the
SFLC, for the FSF's aims, rather than the goal of getting good source
into Linux (and all other code bases).  We don't want this to come off
as some conspiracy theory, but we simply urge those developers caution
&mdash; they should ensure that the path they are being shown by those who
have positioned themselves as leaders is still true.  Run for yourself,
not for their agenda.
<p>
The Race is there to be run, for ourselves, not for others.  We do
what we do to run our own race, and finish it the best we can.  We
don't rush off at every distraction, or worry how this will affect our
image.  We are here to have fun doing right.

<p>
As developers of a free operating system, one of our prime responsibilities
is device support.  No matter how nice an operating system is, it remains
useless and unusable without solid support for a wide percentage of the
hardware that is available on the market.  It is therefore rather unsurprising
that more than half of our efforts focus on various aspects relating to
device support.
<p>
Most parts of the operating system (from low kernel, through to libraries,
all the way up to X, and then even to applications) use fairly obvious
interface layers, where the "communication protocols" or "argument passing"
mechanisms (ie. APIs) can be understood by any developer who takes the
time to read the free code.  Device drivers pose an additional and significant
challenge though: because many vendors refuse to document the exact behavior
of their devices.  The devices are black boxes.  And often they are surprisingly
weird, or even buggy.
<p>
When vendor documentation does not exist, the development process can
become extremely hairy.  Groups of developers have found themselves focused
for months at a time, figuring out the most simple steps, simply because
the hardware is a complete mystery.  Access to documentation can ease
these difficulties rapidly.  However, getting access to the chip documentation
from vendors is ... almost always a negotiation.  If we had open access to
documentation, anyone would be able to see how simple all these devices
actually are, and device driver development would flourish (and not just in
OpenBSD, either).
<p>
When we proceed into negotiations with vendors, asking for documentation,
our position is often weak.  One would assume that the modern market is fair,
and that selling chips would be the primary focus of these vendors.  But
unfortunately a number of behemoth software vendors have spent the last 10 or
20 years building
<a href="papers/brhard2007/mgp00024.html">
political hurdles against the smaller players</a>.
<p>
A particularly nasty player in this regard has been the Linux vendors and
some Linux developers, who have played along with an American corporate model
of requiring NDAs for chip documentation.  This has effectively put Linux
into the club with Microsoft, but has left all the other operating system
communities &mdash; and their developers &mdash; with much less available clout for
requesting documentation.  In a more fair world, the Linux vendors would
work with us, and the device driver support in all free operating systems
would be fantastic by now.
<p>
We only ask that
<a href="papers/brhard2007/mgp00027.html">
users help</a> us in changing the political landscape.

<td class=lyrics>
<p>
Here's an old story ...<br>
<p>
<br>
Puffy Baba and the 40 Vendors<br>
We all know the details<br>
Magic cave, magic words, some thieves,<br>
some serious loot,<br>
and lucky &mdash; Mister &mdash; Baba<br>
Who got a bad rap if you ask me<br>
The little guy who<br>
did the best with what he had<br>
<p>
<br>
Here are Mr. Baba's lessons<br>
Load one ass, take a few trips and spend<br>
in moderation<br>
Three things the average man can't &mdash; get &mdash; right<br>
<p>
<br>
If you know your brother is a greedy bastard<br>
never give him the password<br>
If he goes penguin on you,<br>
stop &mdash; being &mdash; his brother.<br>
When a cave is guarded by magic lawyers<br>
A sea of blood will be its doormat<br>
So do the best with what you have<br>
<p>
<br>
Beyond the lessons &mdash; you must know this<br>
that the Devil is as real as your address<br>
But unlike Vendors,<br>
he at least keeps the door open<br>
<p>
<br>
Vendors of water that should be free<br>
Look upon their words and despair<br>
Their badvertising made a thief of my brother<br>
then made him better off dead<br>
Now he hasn't got shit to do his best with<br>
<p>
<br>
Gratis. Free. Libre. Cuffo.<br>
The companies of thieves stole every good adjective<br>
and left us with open source (sores)<br>
sharing smaller and smaller bandages<br>
for each consecutive cut<br>
But with the salty water of labour<br>
parched desert becomes pregnant black soil<br>
<p>
<br>
It's not whether you're well off<br>
it's where you dig the well<br>
The best the little guy can do is what<br>
the little guy does right<br>

This is an extra track by the artist Ty Semaka
(who really has "had Puffy on his mind") which we included on the "The Songs 3.0 - 4.0" audio CD.
<p>
This song details the process that Ty has to go through to make the art
and music for each OpenBSD release.
Ty and Theo really do go to a (very specific) bar and discuss what is
going on in the project, and then try to find a theme that will work...
<p>
The 1st OpenBSD Audio CD "The Songs 3.0 - 4.0" celebrates the artwork
and songs that have been released with each OpenBSD release.  All the

<p>
The last 10 years, every 6 month period has (without fail)
resulted in an official OpenBSD release making it to the FTP
servers.  But CDs are also manufactured, which the project
sells to continue our development goals.
<p>
While tests of the release binaries are done by developers
around the world, Theo and some developers from Calgary
or Edmonton (such as Peter Valchev or Bob Beck) test that
the discs are full of (only) correct code.  Ty Semaka works for
approximately two months to design and draw artwork that will fit
the designated theme, and coordinates with his music buddies to
write and record a song that also matches the theme.
<p>
Then the discs and all the artwork gets delivered to the plant,
so that they can be pressed in time for an official release date.
<p>
This release, instead of bemoaning vendors or organizations that
try to make our task of writing free software more difficult, we
instead celebrate the 10 years that we have been given (so far) to
write free software, express our themes in art, and the 5 years
that we have made music with a group of talented musicians.
<p>
OpenBSD developers have been torturing each other for years now
with Humppa-style music, so this release our users get a taste
of this too.  Sometimes at hackathons you will hear the same
songs being played on multiple laptops, out of sync.  It is
under such duress that much of our code gets written.
<p>
We feel like Pufferix and Bobilix delivering The Three Discs of
Freedom to those who want them whenever the need arises, then
returning to celebrate the (unlocked) source tree with all the
other developers.

<p>
OpenBSD emphasizes security. It also emphasizes openness. All the code
is there for all to see. Blobs are vendor-compiled binary drivers
without any source code. Hardware makers like them because they
obscure the details of how to make their hardware work. They hide bugs
and workarounds for bugs. Newer versions of blobs can weaken support
for older hardware and motivate people to buy new hardware.
<p>
Blobs are expedient. Many other open source operating systems
cheerfully incorporate them; in fact their users demand them.
<p>
But when you need to trust the system, how do you check the blob for
quality? For adherence to standards? How do you know the blob contains
no malicious code? No incompetent code? Inspection is impossible; you
can only test the black box. And when it breaks, you have no idea why.
<ul>
<li>Blobs can be 'de-supported' by vendors at any time.
<li>Blobs cannot be supported by developers.
<li>Blobs cannot be fixed by developers.
<li>Blobs cannot be improved.
<li>Blobs cannot be audited.
<li>Blobs are specific to an architecture, thus less portable.
<li>Blobs are quite often massively bloated.
</ul>
<p>
This release, like every OpenBSD release, contains OpenBSD and its
source code. It runs on a wide variety of hardware. It contains many
new features and improvements. OpenBSD does attempt to convince
vendors to release documentation, and often reverse-engineers around
the need for blobs. OpenBSD remains blob-free. Anyone can look at it,
assess it, improve it. If it breaks, it can be fixed.

<div class=commentary>
<p>
For a multitude of (stupid) reasons, vendors often attempt to lock
out our participation with their customers by refusing to give our
programmers sufficient documentation so that we can properly support
their devices.
<p>
Take Adaptec for instance.  Before the 3.7 release we disabled support
for the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/?query=aac&amp;sektion=4">aac(4)</a>
Adaptec RAID driver because negotiations with the Adaptec had failed.
They refused to give us documentation.  Without documentation, support
for their controller had always been poor.  The driver had bugs (which
affected some users more than others) which caused crashes, and of
course there was no RAID management support.  Apparently most of these
bugs are because the Adaptec controllers have numerous buggy firmware
issues which require careful workarounds; without documentation we
cannot solve these issues.
<p>
The driver was written by an OpenBSD developer, who cribbed parts
of it from a FreeBSD driver written by an ex-Adaptec employee.  But no
public documentation exists, and Adaptec has dozens of cards with
different firmware issues. All of this adds up to a very desperate
development model &mdash; it becomes very hard for the principle of
"quality" to show its head.
<p>
RAID devices have two main qualities that people buy them for:
<ul>
<li>Redundancy
<li>Repair
</ul>
<p>
You want a RAID unit to provide you with redundancy, so that if some drives
fail, your data is not lost.  But once a drive has failed, you require your
array to (automatically, most likely) perform the operations to repair
itself, so that it is functioning perfectly again.
<p>
Some vendors (or like the above Adaptec case, ex-employee) have
sometimes given us some documentation so that we could write drivers,
so that their devices could support Redundancy.  But these vendors have
never given us any documentation for performing Repairs.
<p>
Instead these vendors have tried to pass out non-free RAID management
tools.  These are typically gigantic Linux binaries, or some crazy thing, that
is supposed to work through a bizarre interface in the device driver, which
we are apparently supposed to write code for without any documentation.
<p>
And since we refuse to accept our users being forced into depending on
vendor binaries, we have reverse engineered the management interface for
the AMI controllers.
<p>
There is no great "intellectual property" in this stuff, it is all
rather simple primitives.  This is all that we need to implement
basic RAID management:
<ul>
<li>SCSI transactions on the back-side busses

<p>
The AMI driver needed to support these small primitive operations.
And once we had that, we rely on something else which we know: Almost
all the RAID controllers would need the same primitives.
<p>
Thus armed, we were able to write a generic framework which would later
work on other vendors' RAID cards, that is, once we get documentation
or do some reverse engineering for their products.
<p>
But having been ignored for so long by these vendors, it is not clear when (if
ever) we will get around to writing that support for Adaptec RAID
controllers now.  And Adaptec has gone and bought ICP Vortex, which
may mean we can never get documentation for the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/?query=gdt&amp;sektion=4">gdt(4)</a>
controllers.
The "Open Source Friendly liar" IBM owns Mylex, and Mylex has told us we
would not get documentation, either.
3Ware has lied to us and our users so many times they make politicians
look saintly.
<p>
Until other vendors give us documentation, if you want reliable RAID
in OpenBSD, please buy
LSI/AMI RAID cards.  And everything
<a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&amp;m=112630095818062&amp;w=2">
will just work</a>.
<p>
And keep pestering the other vendors.

<p>
For an operating system to get anywhere in "the market" it must have
good device support.
<p>
Ethernet was our first concern. Many vendors refused to supply
programmers with programming documentation for these chipsets.  Donald
Becker (Linux) and Bill Paul (FreeBSD) changed the rules of the game
here: They wrote drivers for the chipsets that they could get
documentation for, and as they succeeded in writing more and more
drivers, eventually closed vendors slowly opened up until most
ethernet chipset documentation was available.  Today, some vendors
still resist releasing ethernet chipset documentation (ie. Broadcom,
Intel, Marvell/SysKonnect, NVIDIA) but the driver problem is mostly
solved in the ethernet market.
<p>
Similar problems have happened in the SCSI, IDE, and RAID markets.
Again, the problem was solved by writing drivers for documented
devices first. If the free software user communities use those drivers
preferentially, it is a market loss for the secretive vendors.
Another approach that has worked is to publish email addresses and
phone numbers for the marketing department managers in these
companies.  These email campaigns have worked almost every time.
<p>
The new frontier: 802.11 wireless chipsets.
<p>
Over the last six months, this came to a head in the OpenBSD project.
We asked our users to help us petition numerous vendors so that we
could get chipset documentation or redistributable firmware.  Certainly, we did
not succeed for some vendors.  But we did influence some vendors, in
particular the Taiwanese (Ralink and Realtek), who have given us
everything we need.  We also reverse engineered the Atheros chipsets.
<p>
Want to help us?  Avoid
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/?query=ipw">Intel Centrino</a>,
Broadcom, TI, or Connexant PrismGT chipsets.
Heck, avoid buying even regular
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/?query=wi">old pre-G Prism products</a>,
to send a message.
If you can, buy 802.11 products using chips by
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/?query=rtw">Realtek</a>,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/?query=ral">Ralink</a>,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/?query=atu">Atmel</a>,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/?query=awi">ADMTek</a>,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/?query=ath">Atheros</a>.
Our manual pages attempt to explain which vendors (ie. D-Link) box
which chipsets into which product.
<p>
Send a message that open support for hardware matters.  A vendor in
Redmond largely continues their practices because they get
the chipset documentation years before everyone else does.
What really upsets us the most is that some Linux vendors are signing
Non-Disclosure Agreements with vendors, or contracts that let them
distribute firmwares. Meanwhile both Linux and FSF head developers
are not asking their communities to help us in our efforts to free
development information for all, but are even going further and
telling their development communities to not work with us at
pressuring vendors.  It is ridiculous.

What is up with some free software providers?!
They say "Here's something free!  Oh wait, I changed my mind."
<p>
While not exactly bait-and-switch, this is something which
has been causing the community continual grief, and therefore
we decided to honour a few of the projects that have decided
to go non-free.  After all.. having gone non-free, no one is
going to remember them in the end.
<p>
This song is dedicated to a few worthy groups who
have made this Free-to-Non-Free transition with their
offerings in the last few years:
<ul>
<li>David Dawes worked for years with a team of
developers to make a free X11 distribution for us to use,
called XFree86, 98% of which was based on entirely free
code from MIT. Suddenly, one day, he decided that
we must give him more credit (ie. advertise his name) or
stop using it.  Within about 4 months every project had
told him to get stuffed, and the community has created a
replacement effort.
Now his team cannot even keep their web pages up to date...
<li>OpenBSD was the first operating system to integrate a
packet filter, and it was the ipf codebase from Darren Reed
that we chose.  But a few years later he told us that we
were not free to make changes to the code.  So we deleted ipf,
and our new packet filter far exceeds the capabilities of the
one he wrote. And other projects are switching too...
<li>The Apache group started from the humble beginnings
of just being 'a patchy' set of changes to a completely free
web server of dubious quality.  But the years have changed them,
and what they supply is now quite non-free... released under
a license so entangled in legalese that we have absolutely no
doubt that there are encumbrances hidden within.  Legal terms
protect.  Who are they protecting?  Not your freedom.
</ul>
<p>
So here's a goodbye to those three groups, and a warning to any
others who will follow them:
Make your stuff non-free, and something else will
replace it.
</div>

<td class=lyrics>
<p>
Well he rode from the ocean far upstream<br>
Nuthin' to his name but a code and a dream<br>
Lookin' for the legendary inland sea<br>
Where the water was deep n' clean n' free<br>
<p>
But the town he found had suffered a blow<br>
Fish were dying, cause the water was low<br>
Fat cat fish name o' Diamond Dawes<br>
Plugged the stream with copyright laws<br>
<p>
<br>
He said my water's good n' my water's free<br>
So Pond-erosa, you gonna thank me!<br>
Then he bottled it up and he labeled it "Mine"<br>
They opened n' poured, but they ran outta time!<br>
<p>
So Puff made a brand and he tanned his hide<br>
Said. "this is the mark of too much pride"<br>
Tied him to a horse, set the tail on fire<br>
Slapped er on the ass and the water went higher!<br>
<p>
<br>
Pond-erosa Puff<br>
wouldn't take no guff<br>
Water oughta be clean and free<br>
So he fought the fight<br>
and he set things right<br>
With his OpenBSD<br>
<p>
<br>
Well things were good fer a spell in town<br>
But then one day, dang water turned brown<br>
Comin' to the rescue, Mayor Reed<br>
He said, "This here filter's all ya'll need"<br>
<p>
But it didn't take long 'fore the filter plugged<br>
Full of mud, n' crud, n' bugs<br>
Folks said "gotta be a gooder way"<br>
Mayor said "Hell No! She's O.K."<br>
<p>
<br>
"The water's fine on the Open range"<br>
And he passed a law that it couldn't change.<br>
"No freeze, no boil, no frolicking young"<br>
Puff took him aside, said "this is wrong"<br>
<p>
Then he found the Mayor was addin' the crud!<br>
So he took him down in a cloud of blood<br>
Said "The Mayor's learnd, he's done been mean"<br>
So they did it right and the water went clean!<br>
<p>
<br>
CHORUS
<p>
<br>
So once agin' it was right, but then<br>
The lake went dry, she was gone again!<br>
Fish started flippin' and floppin' about<br>
Yellin' "Mercy Puff! It's a doggone drought!"<br>
<p>
So he rolled up-gulch till he hit the lake<br>
Of Apache fish, they was on the take<br>
They'd built a dam that was made of rules<br>
Now Puff was pissed and he lost his cool!<br>
<p>
<br>
I'm sick and tired of these goldarn words!<br>
n' laws n' bureaucratic nerds!<br>
You're full o' beans n' killin' my town<br>
and if you's all don't shut er down<br>
<p>
I'll hang a lickin' on every one<br>
of you sons o' bitchin' greedy scum!<br>
So he blew the dam, an' he let 'er haul<br>
Cause water oughta be free for all!<br>
<p>
<br>
CHORUS
<p>
<br>
That's right!<br>
I'll hang a lickin' on ya!<br>
Never piss on another man's boot!<br>

<p>
A common theme used by the comedy crew Monty Python was to emphasize
and exaggerate ridiculousnesses that their target had imposed upon
themselves.  Few things could be considered as humorous as making a
redundancy protocol... redundant; e.g. being forced to replace it by
Cisco lawyers and IETF policy.
<p>
We've been working a few years now on our packet filtering software
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/?query=pf&amp;sektion=4">pf(4)</a>
and it became time to add failover.  We want to be able to set up pf
firewalls side by side, and exchange the stateful information between
them, so that in case of failure another could take over 'keep state'
sessions.  Our
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/?query=pfsync&amp;sektion=4">pfsync(4)</a>
protocol solves this problem.  However, on both sides of the firewall,
it is also necessary to have all the regular hosts not see a
network failure.  The only reliable way to do this is for both
firewall machines to have and use the same IP and MAC addresses.  But
the only real way to do that is to use multicast protocols.
<p>
The IETF community proposed work in this direction in the late
90's, however in 1997 Cisco informed them that they believed some of
Cisco's patents covered the proposed IETF VRRP (Virtual Router
Redundancy Protocol); on
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/ietf/IPR/VRRP-CISCO">
March 20, 1998 they went further and specifically named their HSRP
"Hot Standby Router Protocol" patent</a>.  Reputedly, they were upset
that IETF had not simply adopted the flawed HSRP protocol as the
standard solution for this problem.  Despite this legal pressure, the
IETF community forged ahead and published VRRP as a standard even
though there was a patent in the space.  Why?
<a href="http://mirror.switch.ch/ftp/doc/ietf/vrrp/vrrp-minutes-97dec.txt">
There was much deliberation</a>
at all levels of the IETF, and unfortunately for all of us the
politicians within eventually decided to allow patented technology in
standards &mdash; as long as the patented technology is licensed under RAND
(Reasonable And Non Discriminatory) terms.  As free software
programmers, we therefore find ourselves in the position that these
RAND standards must not be implemented by us, and we must deviate from
the standard.  We find all this rather Unreasonable and Discriminatory
and we *will* design competing protocols.  Some standards organization,
eh?
<p>
Due to some HSRP flaws fixed by VRRP and for compatibility with the
(HSRP-licensed) VRRP implementations of their competitors, Cisco in
recent times has largely abandoned HSRP and now relies on VRRP instead
&mdash; a protocol designed for and by the community, but for which they
claim patent rights.
<p>
On August 7 2002, after many communications, Robert Barr (Cisco's
lawyer) firmly informed the OpenBSD community that Cisco would defend
its patents for VRRP implementations &mdash; meaning basically that it was
impossible for a free software group to produce a truly free
implementation of the IETF standard protocol.  Perhaps this is because
Cisco and Alcatel are currently engaged in a pair of patent lawsuits; a
small piece of which is Cisco attempting to use the HSRP patent
against Alcatel for their use of VRRP.  Some IETF working group
members took note of our complaints,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061109082106/http://lists.microshaft.org/pipermail/dmca_discuss/2003-April/004702.html">
however an attempt in April 2003 to have the IETF abandon the use of
patented technology failed to "reach consensus" in the IETF</a>.
<p>
A few years ago, the W3C, who designs our web protocols, tried to move
to a RAND policy as well (primarily because of pressure from Microsoft
and Apple), but the community outrage was so overpowering that they
backed down.  Some standards groups use this policy, while others
avoid it &mdash; the one differentiation being the amount of corporate
participation. In the IETF, the pro-RAND agents work for AT&amp;T,
Alcatel, IBM, Cisco, Microsoft, and other large companies.  Since IETF
is an open forum, they can blend in as the populace, and vote just
like all others, except against the community.
<p>
Translation: In failing to "reach consensus", the companies who
benefit from RAND won, and the community lost again.
<p>
Left with little choice, we proceeded to reinvent the wheel or, more
correctly, abandon the wheel entirely and go for a "hovercraft".  We
designed CARP (Common Address Redundancy Protocol) to solve the same
problem that these other protocols are designed for, but without the
same technological basis as HSRP and VRRP.  We read the patent
document carefully and ensured that CARP was fundamentally different.
We also avoided many of the flaws in HSRP and VRRP (such as an inherent
lack of security).  And since we are OpenBSD developers, we designed
it to use cryptography.
<p>
The combination of
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/?query=pf&amp;sektion=4">pf(4)</a>,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/?query=pfsync&amp;sektion=4">pfsync(4)</a>, and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/?query=carp&amp;sektion=4">carp(4)</a>
has permitted us to build highly redundant firewalls.  To date, we
have built a few networks that include as many as 4 firewalls, all
running random reboot cycles.  As long as one firewall is alive in a
group, traffic through them moves smoothly and correctly for all of
our packet filter functionality.  Cisco's low end products are unable
to do this reliably, and if they have high end products which can do
this, you most certainly cannot afford them.
<p>
As a final note of course, when we petitioned IANA, the IETF body
regulating "official" internet protocol numbers, to give us numbers
for CARP and pfsync our request was denied.  Apparently we had failed
to go through an official standards organization.  Consequently we
were forced to choose a protocol number which would not conflict with
anything else of value, and decided to place CARP at IP protocol 112.
We also placed pfsync at an open and unused number. We informed IANA of
these decisions, but they declined to reply.
<p>
This ridiculous situation then inspired one of our developers to create
this parody of the well-known Monty Python skit and song.

A license for my network redundancy protocol, CARP.
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
Well, it's free isn't it?
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
Exactly, the protocol's name is CARP.  CARP the redundancy protocol.
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
What?
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
He is an.... redundancy protocol.
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
CARP is a free redundancy protocol!
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
Yes, I chose it out of three, I didn't like the others,
they were all too... encumbered.  And now I must license it!
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
You must be a looney.
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
I am not a looney!  Why should I be tied with the epithet looney merely
because I wish to protect my redundancy protocol?  I've heard tell
that Network Associates has a pet algorithm called RSA used in IETF
standards, and you wouldn't call them a looney; Geoworks has a claim
on WAP, after what their lawyers do to you if you try to implement it.
Cisco has two redundant patents, both encumbered, and Cadtrack has a
patent on cursor movement!  So, if you're calling the large American
companies that fork out millions of dollars for the use of XOR a
bunch of looneys, I shall have to ask you to step outside!
<dt>Licenser:

Alright, alright, alright.  A license.
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
Yes.
<dt>Licenser:

For a free redundancy protocol?
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
Yes.
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
You are a looney.
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
Look, it allows for bleeding redundancy doesn't it? Cisco's got a
patent for the HSRP, and I've got to get a license for me router
VRRP.
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
You don't need a license for your VRRP.
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
I bleeding well do and I got one.  It can't be called VRRP without it.
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
There's no such thing as a bloody VRRP license.
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
Yes there is!
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
Isn't!
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
Is!
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
Isn't!
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
I bleeding got one, look!  What's that then?
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
This is a Cisco HSRP patent document with the word "Cisco" crossed
out and the word "IETF" written in crayon.
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
The man didn't have the right form.
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
What man?
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
Robert Barr, the man from the redundancy detector van.
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
The looney detector van, you mean.
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
Look, it's people like you what cause unrest.
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
What redundancy detector van?
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
The redundancy detector van from the Monopoly of Cizzz-coeee.
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
Cizzz-coeee?
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
It was spelt like that on the van.  I'm very observant!  I never seen
so many bleeding aerials.  The man said that their equipment could
pinpoint a failover configuration at 400 yards!  And my Cisco router,
being such a flappy bat, was a piece of cake.
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
How much did you pay for that?
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
Sixty quid, and twenty grand for the PIX.
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
What PIX?
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
The PIX I'm replacing!
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
So you're replacing your PIX with free software, and yet you want to
license it?
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
There's nothing so odd about that. I'm sure they patented this
protocol too.  After all, the IETF had a hand in it!
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
No they didn't!
<dt>Customer:
<dd>
Did!
<dt>Licenser:
<dd>
Didn't!
<dt>Customer:

<div class=commentary>
<p>
Join Puffy Hood and his Funny Fish as they take on
the Sheriff (an unelected leader) and other evil
forces of the draconian government!
<p>
As we did for the 3.3 release, we have once again tried
making release artwork and music which are allegorical
of recent happenings.
<p>
Two years ago we became involved with the University
of Pennsylvania and DARPA, who were funding us to do
security research and development .. on things that
we were already intending to do.  We provided ideas,
wrote papers, and deployed cutting-edge technology;
DARPA provided finances and reaped a share of the
credit, and the University of Pennsylvania acted as
a middle-man.  We accepted funding based on the
promise that our freedom to operate as we wished
was unaffected. To us, freedom is more important
than funding &mdash; heck, we were dealing with the evil
forces of government, and needed to be careful.
<p>
A few months prior to this release, DARPA suddenly
and without warning decided to withdraw that funding;
they also aggressively backed out of contractual
obligations.  Many articles in the press followed regarding
this sudden maneuver.  Apparently this hoopla happened
because an OpenBSD-related article in the Canadian
newspaper The Globe &amp; Mail had quoted Theo de Raadt
making anti-war statements regarding Iraq and the
theft of oil.
<p>
The only answer given (to major media reporters) by a
DARPA spokesperson (Jan Walker) was this:
<p>
&quot;As a result of the DARPA review of the
project, and due to world events and the evolving
threat posed by increasingly capable nation-states,
the Government on April 21 advised the University
to suspend work on the "security fest" portion of
the project.&quot;
<p>
That almost toes the line of calling us terrorists!
We had lost financial support, but the release of the
statement above suddenly made us very happy to be free
of any perceived obligation to such crazy people.
<p>
Since the termination came near natural contract
termination (about 4 months remained), less damage
than expected was sustained by the project.  Sponsors
stepped forward and helped us make up the missing funds
we needed to run our "Hackathon", and the event
proceeded as planned.  We even had T-shirts made with
"Workstations of Mass Development" artwork for those
developers who attended (sorry, they are not for sale).
<p>
We could not make stories like this up.  So instead,
we are making up an allegory about it, using the tale
of Robin Hood.
</div>

<td class=lyrics>
<p>
Sir Puffy of Ramsay was a wandrin'<br>
Through forests of seaweed all alone<br>
He had found the crusades<br>
were an endless charade<br>
So for now he called Nothing Hack home<br>
<p>
<br>
One day he met Little Bob of Beckley<br>
Beat him fair on a log-in by staff<br>
Clever chums they did find<br>
other fish of their kind<br>
Thwarting evil with humppa and math<br>
<p>
<br>
Now trouble was a brewin' when the Good King was away<br>
The Sheriff came a callin' for the poor to pay<br>
With CD's and their freedom<br>
for to share online<br>
And burning down the village cause he was a slime<br>
<p>
<br>
So Puffy and his buddies took the booty from the rich<br>
and turned it into a system to protect poor fish<br>
Sent out by Hook or a Wim<br>
to the teaming schools<br>
Town cryers were on fire cause the crypto ruled!<br>
<p>
<br>
<em>Chorus:</em><br>
They called it "BSD"!<br>
And "Open" because it's always free<br>
So raise up your glass and<br>
three cheers to the Funny<br>
Fish for never running<br>
and making something good!<br>
And here's to Puffy Hood!<br>
<p>
<br>
Aaaw! Word to the sea y'all<br>
The Hood's a bad ball<br>
Ya underneath he's a heathen and a traitor<br>
He can take from you all and say "later!"<br>
Think he's a hero?<br>
Naw he ain't lovin' ya<br>
He gettin' richer than Bill Gates and Dubya<br>
Read the Wanted poster<br>
of Sheriff Plac-o-derm fool<br>
We gettin' back the booty<br>
or we take away your worms too<br>
<p>
<br>
Yo! Word to the classes<br>
Put on your glasses<br>
I guess the Sheriff is King till this passes<br>
Times are a changin' and movin' so fast<br>
He says "Give me your freedom,<br>
I'll grasp it and pass it to brass<br>
who can hash it for weapons of massive distraction.<br>
And hand me the bastards that brashly amassed from the cash<br>
happy faction of oily and gassy co-action".<br>
No! Don't hand em dick, grab a stick, keep attacking for freedom<br>
and hack till the King cometh back and leave em'<br>
<p>
<br>
Then trouble was a rollin' with an army on the run<br>
The Sheriff came a callin' for the spikey one<br>
And took back all the booty<br>
Puff intended for the poor<br>
The Arch-a-thon went on despite the mighty roar<br>
<p>
<br>
Puff snuck into the castle, and found the treasure hill<br>
And also found Maid Marlin held against her will<br>
He loaded all the loot<br>
to give it back and big surprise<br>
He took the maiden too, 'cause she was easy on the eyes<br>
<p>
<br>
<em>Chorus:</em><br>
They called it "BSD"!<br>
And "Open" because it's always free<br>
So raise up your glass and<br>
three cheers to the Funny<br>
Fish for never running<br>
and making something good!<br>
And here's to Puffy Hood!<br>

<p>
Like other Barbarians before him, Puff has had to
face some pretty crazy challenges.
<p>
This song is an allegory of the recent difficulties
we went through dealing with Sun, who refused our
request for documentation about their UltraSPARC
III processors.  We want documentation, because
these are the fastest processors with a per-page
eXecute bit in the MMU, needed to fully support
our new W^X security feature.  In the meantime,
the AMD Hammer has come onto the scene, and
this processor supports an eXecute bit in 64-bit
mode.
<p>
And it is going to be faster...<br>
</div>

<td class=lyrics>
<p>
Deep through the mists of time<br>
Gaze to the crystal ball<br>
Back to the age of darkness<br>
Black was the protocol<br>
<p>
A King ruled the web with fear<br>
Spilling the blood of men<br>
Then from the ocean came<br>
Puff the Barbarian<br>
<p>
<br>
Born in a tiny bowl Puff was a pet<br>
Sold into slav-er-y by the man<br>
Eating the weeds till he was strong enough<br>
Breaking his bonds like nobody can<br>
<p>
Down the sewer pipes of Hell<br>
A thousand kitties then did bleed<br>
Constraints were slain as well<br>
Hacked his way out to the C<br>
<p>
And there he found<br>
His destiny<br>
Hammer of the Ocean God<br>
"Xor taking care of me"<br>
<p>
Then in a dream Xor requested he<br>
"Go to the Sun King, get what I yearn<br>
Kernighan saw it, prophet of the C<br>
Knowledge &mdash; so they may never return"<br>
<p>
At the tower Puff appealed<br>
For the wisdom of the One<br>
Denied, his mind did reel<br>
Puff was getting tired of Sun<br>
<p>
Broke down the guard<br>
Cause math is hard<br>
Saw McNealy on his throne<br>
All alone and only bones<br>
<p>
Come the Sun King blade ablur<br>
Hammer down eclipse the Sun<br>
And Puff, the land secured<br>
The new King Barbarian!<br>
