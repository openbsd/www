This is a partial list of new features and systems included in OpenBSD 7.7.
For a comprehensive list, see the <a href="plus77.html">changelog</a> leading to 7.7.
<p>
<ul>

<li>Platforms specific improvements:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="arm64.html">arm64</a>:
    <ul>
    <li>Set AP power state, fixing the SMC initialization on the M1 MacBook with the latest system firmware.
    <li>Implemented a new pmap_populate() interface on arm64 and riscv64
	to help <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pmap_enter.9">pmap_enter(9)</a> succeed
	when there's enough free physical memory but we can't allocate KVA to
	map that memory.
    <li>Optimized pmap teardown by skipping TLB flushes, giving ~5%
	performance boost for kernel build on arm64. 
    <li>Enabled PAC on hardware that uses the new QARMA3 cipher.
    <li>Implemented support for SVE (Scalable Vector Extension) on arm64.

    </ul>
  <li><a href="amd64.html">amd64</a>::
    <ul>
    <li>Added the ability for <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/bus_dmamem_alloc.9">bus_dmamem_alloc(9)</a>
	to recognize the BUS_DMA_64BIT flag and allocate memory for DMA
	without any 4GB restrictions on amd64.
    <li>Allowed boot loader to run as AMD SEV guest on QEMU with EFI.
    <li>Allowed kernel boot on QEMU with AMD SEV.
    <li>Allowed use of MSI with the QEMU default pc-i440fx machine.

	looking only for low pages.
  <li>Added a helper to check if memory has been freed for a given
	request to improve speed of the page daemon loop.
  <li>Started accounting for in-flight pages being written to disk when
	the page daemon is computing page shortage.

  <li>Adjusted the ptrace interface to properly support
	single-threaded continue and make it possible to use breakpoints in

	ensuring execution does not stop until the breakpoint is hit at least
	that many times.
  <li>Taught <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a> how to
	disassemble endbr64.
  <li>Moved <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dt.4">dt(4)</a> to using

  <li>Implement <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/busdma.9">busdma(9)</a> bounce buffering
	for raw memory.
  <li>Started ignoring sub-nodes of non-functional nodes in the ACPI
	tree walk to fix double and triple attachments of the same PCIe root
	bridges.

  <li>Suspend/Hibernate Support
  <ul>
  <li>Ensured all
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/apm.8">hibernate</a>
    data is written inside the allocated chunk of swap.
  <li>Removed unneeded zeroing of free pages during
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/apm.8">hibernate</a>.
  <li>Corrected
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/apm.8">hibernate</a>
    error detection during RLE writes.

	multithreaded processes can be reliably stopped and continued. This
	should fix problems seen in golang, mpv and in our regress tests.
  <li>Fix possible races of changes to the per-process unveil
	datastructures by either pledge() [removing all path promises] or
	unveil() [adding new paths], against namei() inspecting in other
	thread system calls.
  </ul>
  </ul>

	fstatat(2)
  <li>Unlocked <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wskbd.4">wskbd(4)</a> kqueue filterops.
  <li>Used `ws_mtx' <a

	VMs we don't need the quirk for old, broken ACPI.  This solves
	problems with PCI BAR access and recent seabios versions on qemu.
  </ul>

<li>Various new userland features:
  <ul>
  <li>Numerous changes to make the
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/imsg_init.3">imsg</a> API
	stricter and better, which were followed
	by adapting all applications across the tree.
  <li>Allow the user to provide an alternative perfpolicy when on
	battery, extending the semantics of hw.perfpolicy to provide two
	buttons to specify desired behavior. This gives users more flexibility
	in setting the performance when AC-powered vs. battery powered.

	device nodes and setuid files. Avoids false positives when changing
	timezones.
  <li>Added a new variable PASSWDSKIP that can be set in
	/etc/daily.local to prevent <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/security.8">security(8)</a> from
	complaining about specific accounts that have no password. This is
	typically used for services like anoncvs and gotd.
  <li>Added [-f file] to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.8">sysctl(8)</a> to apply
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.conf.5">sysctl.conf(5)</a>
	in one go, and started using it in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.8">rc(8)</a> instead of a parser implemented in ksh.
  <li>Added support for read/write of xmm/ymm registers to clangs <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/lldb.1">lldb(1)</a>.
  </ul>

<li>Various bugfixes and tweaks in userland:

	href="https://man.openbsd.org/getgrouplist.3">getgrouplist(3)</a>
	always return the total number of groups found.
  <li>Ignore extra groups that don't fit in the buffer passed to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/getgrouplist.3">getgrouplist(3)</a>,
	providing only the kernel maximum of sixteen groups.
  <li>Prevent <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/newsyslog.8">newsyslog(8)</a> from running
	through time checks when an entry needs to be rotated based on size.
  <li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ps.1">ps(1)</a> to print
	the session id (PID of the session leader) instead of a pointer with
	display argument 'sess'.
  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cu.1">cu(1)</a>, map ucom
	unit number to cuaU number using the same scheme MAKEDEV uses, fixing
	problems with ucom units > 10.
  <li>Made CPU frequencies human-readable with <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/systat.1">systat(1)</a> sensors -h.
  <li>Fixed a bug where <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/getty.8">getty(8)</a> dx flag was
	supposed to set decctlq, but was setting ixany instead.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1">pkg_add(1)</a> run <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ldconfig.8">ldconfig(8)</a> after each
	updateset if the list of shared libraries was changed.
  <li>Corrected behavior of <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sed.1">sed(1)</a> c command to match
	POSIX.
  <li>Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/clang.1">clang(1)</a>
	-fzero-call-used-regs aware of the register used by
	retguard. Qemu is using this, causing a crash.
  <li>Disk partition information is now saved by
	  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/security.8">security(8).</a>
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/security.8">security(8)</a>
	ignore <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/quota.1">quota(1)</a> files
	and all subdirectories of /var/mail when checking the ownership and
	mode of mailboxes.
  <li>Added <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg-config.1">pkg-config(1)</a> support
	for relocatable .pc files.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mandoc.1">mandoc(1)</a> "-T html"
	and "-T markdown" output translate ".%R RFC &lt;number>" to a
	hyperlink to rfc-editor.org.
  <li>Support decimal fractions like "0.25i" in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/roff.7">roff(7)</a> scaled widths
	and arithmetic operations in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tbl.7">tbl(7)</a> column widths,
	as needed for some manual pages written with DocBook.
  <li>When <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/syslogd.8">syslogd(8)</a>
	acting as logserver with TLS (-S) and
	client-certificates are used for authentication (-K), use the CN from
	the client's certificate as hostname.
  <li>Adjusted the alignment when
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/df.1">df(1)</a> prints inode columns.
	This makes
	'df -hi' on systems with large partitions easier on the eyes.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/test.1">test(1)</a> use
	timespeccmp() and st_mtim instead of comparing st_mtime to fix
	comparison of files with modification times that differ by less than a
	second.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1">ksh(1)</a> use
	timespeccmp() and st_mtim intead of comparing st_mtime to fix
	comparison of files with modification times that differ by less than a
	second.
  <li>Added a digit to vsz and rss to accommodate larger processes with <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ps.1">ps(1)</a>.
  <li>Updated <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tzinfo.5">tzinfo(5)</a>
	to 2025bgtz from https://github.com/JodaOrg/global-tz.
  <li>Updated libc/locale support including
	e.g. <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wcwidth.3">wcwidth(3)</a>
	and the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iswalnum.3">iswalnum(3)</a>
        family of functions to Unicode Version 15.0.0.
  </ul>

<li id="hardware_support">Improved hardware support and driver bugfixes, including:<!-- XXX sort -->

  <li>Introduce a pckbc@acpi driver attachment that is use instead of pckbc@isa when an interrupt configuration is incompatible with legacy ISA. This unbreaks, among other things, the keyboards in various Chromebooks.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mtrng.4">mtrng(4)</a>, a driver supporting the 32-bit random number generator on MediaTek SoCs.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mtxhci.4">mtxhci(4)</a>, a driver for the xHCI USB controller found on MediaTek SoCs, and enable it on armv7 and arm64.
  </ul>

<li>New or improved network hardware support:
  <ul>
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ice.4">ice(4)</a>, a driver for Intel E810 devices.
  <li>Increased receive mbuf size with LRO in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vio.4">vio(4)</a>, helping TCP splice performance.
  <li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/xbf.4">xbf(4)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/xnf.4">xnf(4)</a> not attaching on XCP-ng 8.3/Xen 4.17.
  <li>Added printing of number of queues and interrupt and Ethernet address details to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mcx.4">mcx(4)</a>.
  <li>Fixed the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bnxt.4">bnxt(4)</a> receive refill timeout to only refill rings that are currently empty, preventing possible corruption and crashes.
  <li>Added support for AX88772D to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/axen.4">axen(4)</a>.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ixv.4">ixv(4)</a>, a driver for virtual functions of Intel 82598EB, 82559 and X540.
  <li>Enabled rx/tx checksum offloading on <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ivaf.4">ivaf(4)</a>.
  <li>Added RSS/multiqueue support for AQC11x models ("aq2") in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/aq.4">aq(4)</a>.
  <li>Added support for reading eeprom pages for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/aq.4">aq(4)</a> cards with SFP slots.
  <li>Started clearing the OACTIVE flag on tx queues when <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ixl.4">ixl(4)</a> is reset.
  </ul>

<li>Added or improved wireless network drivers:
  <ul>
  <li>Added support for MA devices to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwx.4">iwx(4)</a>.
  <li>Restricted scanned channels appropriately when <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/qwx.4">qwx(4)</a> runs in a fixed phy mode.
  <li>Add support for QCA2066 to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/qwx.4">qwx(4)</a>.
  <li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mtw.4">mtw(4)</a> to only open bulk <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/usb.4">usb(4)</a> pipes once for the lifetime of the device.
  </ul>

<li>Installer, upgrade and bootloader improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>On the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/macppc.html">macppc</a>
	architecture, make ofwboot sync instruction cache before entering
	kernel, preventing a potential boot failure.
<!-- installboot -->
  <li>Made <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/installboot.8">installboot(8)</a>
	install a copy of the UEFI bootloader in /efi/openbsd on the EFI
	system partition, allowing creation of boot options for the firmware
	boot manager other OSes will leave alone.
  <li>Only install a second copy of the bootloader if the EFI
	System Partition is at least 1MB to avoid filling up the tiny ESPs we
	used to create a few releases ago.
  <li>Made <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/installboot.8">installboot(8)</a> only
	set BootOrder if our boot option isn't already part of it. This means
	sysupgrade (or reinstalls) will no longer set OpenBSD as the default
	OS if users change the boot order by some other means.  Fresh installs
	will still make OpenBSD the default OS.
  <li>Added a -c option <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/installboot.8">installboot(8)</a> that
	sets up the machine to boot from the specified disk, used on arm64 and
	amd64 with UEFI and GPT.
<!-- sysupgrade -->
  <li>Added <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade.8">sysupgrade(8)</a> -R #.#
	to try to use a specific release version rather than the immediate
	+0.1.
  <li>Provided a mechanism for getting required keys to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade.8">sysupgrade(8)</a> older
	machines, providing a new set of keybundles signed by older keys to
	allow sysupgrade to securely and automatically download the required
	key.
  <li>Added firmware keys to the signify key bundles. <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade.8">sysupgrade(8)</a> will now
	extract the firmware key also, allowing fw_update fetch the most
	up-to-date firmware before upgrading.
  <li>Added support to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade.8">sysupgrade(8)</a> to
	perform a sysupgrade from a fileset stored on a filesystem. This is
	convenient for offline machines.
<!-- fw_update -->
  <li>Made <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/fw_update.8">fw_update(8)</a> -a mean
	all when downloading or installing, not just deleting.
  <li>Allowed <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/fw_update.8">fw_update(8)</a> to
	download firmware without root.
  <li>Added <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/fw_update.8">fw_update(8)</a> -l flag to
	list drivers or files.
  <li>Added -D option to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/fw_update.8">fw_update(8)</a> for using
	a different dmesg for driver detection.
<!-- installer proper -->
  <li>Reworked the "Default IPv6 router?" question in the installer to
	behave like the other questions.
  <li>On amd64 with ACPI >= 5, assume that the installer booted in
	UEFI mode and default to using a GUID Partition Table (GPT).
  <li>Make IPv6 link-local scope identifiers in "HTTP Server?" answers work in the installer. 
<!-- updates/sysmerge -->
  <li>On updates using <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge.8">sysmerge(8)</a>, added
	options to interactive <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sdiff.1">sdiff(1)</a> merge for choosing
	both sides of a diff.
  </ul>

<li>Security improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>Added sshd-auth to the binaries that relink at boot.
  <li>Split the user authentication code from the sshd-session binary
	into a separate sshd-auth binary. This will be executed by
	sshd-session to complete the user authentication phase of the protocol
	only.  Splitting this code into a separate binary ensures that the
	crucial pre-authentication attack surface has an entirely disjoint
	address space from the code used for the rest of the connection.
  <li>Unveiled <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mountd.8">mountd(8)</a>
	privileged child's write to/create of
	mountdtab file, and drop exec permission.
  </ul>

<li>New features in the network stack: <!--XXX -->
  <ul>
  <li>Added an AF_FRAME socket domain and an IFT_ETHER protocol family
	under it, allowing userland to use sockets to send and receive
	Ethernet frames.
  <li>Added tunneldf support to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sec.4">sec(4)</a>.
  <li>Added use of Toeplitz hash for UDP and IPv6 TCP output, giving an
	improvement in traffic distribution over the queues and 20%
	performance increase with UDP send on v4/v6 and TCP send on v6 without
	pf.
  <li>Cache route per softnet thread with netstack.<!-- XXX commit 1c7441f2bfafacf5a76ad7c383e938238ecc2290 -->

  </ul>

  <li>Further changes and bugfixes in the network stack:
  <ul>
  <li>Replaced rwlock with iterator in UDP input multicast loop, preventing a potential kernel crash.
  <li>Provided <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tun.4">tun(4)</a> network offloads between the kernel and userland and introduced a new TUNSCAP ioctl .
  <li>Ensure that the correct address family is used in ip_deliver()
	for enqueuing a packet, fixing a problem with tunneling of different
	address families.
  <li>Let LLDP packets fall through to being handled on the port
	interfaces for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/aggr.4">aggr(4)</a>.
  <li>Enabled multiqueue for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vio.4">vio(4)</a>.
  <li>Let <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pppoe.4">pppoe(4)</a> data
	packets go through if_vinput instead of the pppoeinq, improving
	throughput and possibly reducing packet loss.
  <li>Fixed out-of-band data in <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/somove.9">somove(9)</a> socket splicing.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wg.4">wg(4)</a> logging of IP addresses of remote endpoints.
  <li>Limited RX queue of loopback interfaces with 8192 packets,
	preventing unlimited queues from reaching mbuf limits and making
	network unusable on some architectures.
  <li>Fixed TCP checksum for IPv6 packets with extension headers.
  <li>Fixed incorrect ICMP error translation in af-to NAT, making
	traceroute6 behind af-to to provide meaningful information.
  <li>Fixed a 24-year old bug where various checks for broadcast
	packets were mistakenly skipped, allowing one to send broadcast
	packets without the SO_BROADCAST option. 

  <!-- ipsec -->
  <li>Prevented installation of path MTU routes for IPsec transport mode SAs.
  </ul>

<li>The following changes were made to the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> firewall:
  <ul>
  <li>Allowed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl.8">pfctl(8)</a>
	specification of interface and queue bandwidths greater than ~4Gbit.
  <li>Fixed inpcb leak in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/divert.4">divert(4)</a> attach.
  </ul>

<li>Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
<ul>
  <li>IPsec support was improved:
  <ul>
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>
	"natt" option that forces negotiation of nat-t (and udpencap).
  </ul>

  <li>More RADIUS changes:
  <ul>
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/radiusd.8">radiusd(8)</a> log the username when rejecting by ipcp.
  </ul>

  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
  <li>Cache the Adj-RIB-Out for sessions that have not been down for
      more than 1h. This significantly improves synchronisation time
      of peers that flap.
  <li>Implement RFC 8538: Notification Message Support for
      BGP Graceful Restart.
  <li>Add support for RFC 8654, extended messages.
  <li>In bgplgd add additional endpoints to query the Adj-RIB-In and
      Adj-RIB-Out.
  <li>Bump internal message size limit to 128k and handle up to 10 000
      ASPA SPAS entries as suggested in draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile.
  <li>Various improvements to the ibuf API including a new reader API
      which is used to make all message parsing in bgpd memory safe.
  <li>Added support for IPsec and TCP MD5 to RTR sessions.
  <li>Improve default multiproto capability announcement selection.
      The default MP capability is only set if no other capability is
      configured on the neighbor.
  <li>The `reject as-set` configuration option now defaults to yes.
      Route announcements with AS_SET segments in the AS_PATH Attribute
      will be rejected. See draft-ietf-idr-deprecate-as-set-confed-set
      for more information.
  <li>The RFC 8654 Extended Message configuration changed from
      "announce extended (yes|no|enforce)" to
      "announce extended message (yes|no|enforce)"
  <li>RFC 8950 - Extended nexthop encoding support in the RIB.
  <li>Preliminary support for EVPN in the RIB.
  <li>When "transparent-as yes" is set, well-known BGP communities are
      passed on according to RFC 7947. This means that IX Route Servers
      transparently pass through NO_EXPORT, NO_ADVERTISE, etc.
  <li>Make the example bgpd.conf work out of the box with 4byte ASN.
  </ul>

  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpki-client.8">rpki-client(8)</a> saw
	these and more changes:
  <ul>
  <li>The generated BIRD config file was reworked. BIRD versions 1.x are no
  longer supported and the -T option to customize the ROA table name was
  removed. The config file now includes the ASPA-set by default and is
  therefore only compatible with BIRD 2.16 and later. If compatibility
  with older BIRD versions is required, the ASPA-set can be excluded
  with the -A flag. Operators should delete any remaining bird1v4 and
  bird1v6 output files.
  <li>Validated ROA payloads from AS0 TALs are by default excluded from the
  output files as they are not recommended for automatic filtering of
  BGP routes. This precaution can be overridden with the new -0 flag.
  <li>Various improvements to the ibuf API, including a new reader API
  which is used to make all message parsing in rpki-client memory safe.
  <li>Warn about gaps in manifest issuance. Such gaps can appear for example
  if rpki-client isn't run frequently enough, if there are issues with
  an RFC 8181 publication server or if there is an operational error on
  the side of the CA.
  <li>Work around a backward compatibility break accidentally introduced
  in OpenSSL 3.4.0, which resulted in all RPKI signed objects being
  rejected. Earlier and later versions of OpenSSL are not affected.
  <li>Improved validity period checking in file mode. The product's lifetime
  and the expiration time of the signature path are now taken into
  account.
  <li>Better cleanup in case of a fallback from RRDP to RSYNC. In rare
  circumstances, files were moved to the wrong place in the cache.
  <li>rpki-client now includes arin.tal which is no longer legally encumbered.
  See https://www.arin.net/announcements/20250116-tal/
  <li>rpki-client reports Certification Authorities that do not meaningfully 
  participate in the RPKI as non-functional CAs. By definition, a CA is
  non-functional if there is no currently valid Manifest. The number of
  such CAs is printed at the end of each run and more detailed information
  is available in the JSON (-j) and ometrics (-m) output.
  <li>Fix a problem where incorrect internal RRDP state handling in
  rpki-client could lead to a denial of service.
  <li>Termination of rsync child processes with SIGTERM is no longer treated as
  an error if rpki-client has sent this signal. This only affects openrsync.
  <li>Do not exit filemode with an error if a .gbr or a .tak object contains
  control characters in its UTF-8 strings. Instead, only warn and emit a
  sanitized version in JSON output.
  </ul>

  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
	<li>Fixed few imprecisions in
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/forward.5">forward(5)</a>
	    with regard to where and when <code>|</code> and
	    <code>:include:</code> are disallowed.
	<li>Fixed the connect filter request documentation in
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd-filters.7">smtpd-filters(7)</a>.
	<li>Proper handling of permanent failures in
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mail.lmtp.8">mail.lmtp(8)</a>,
	    previously all failures were considered temporary and so delivery
	    was attempted again.
  </ul>
<!-- OTHER -->
  <li>Many other changes in various network programs and libraries:
  <ul>

  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.1">acme-client(1)</a> always print account URI on first creation of an account key.
  <li>Added TLS support to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tcpbench.1">tcpbench(1)</a>.
  <li>Started taking into account how long the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ntpd.8">ntpd(8)</a> DNS probe takes
	before deciding to punt.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unwind.8">unwind(8)</a>
	block list wildcard support using block list entries starting with '.'.
  <li>Implemented zoneversion EDNS option (RFC 9660) in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/dig.1">dig(1)</a>.
  <li>Adjusted rDNS lifetime to RFC 8106 default (minimum) value in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/rad.8">rad(8)</a>.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nfsd.8">nfsd(8)</a> default to UDP when using only -n.
  <li>Implemented <a

  <li>Made iscsid send out all the values for session and connection
	params for each login stage, keeping control of what is selected,
	making it possible to connect to a lio target.
  <li>Respect checksum offloading in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcrelay.8">dhcrelay(8)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcrelay6.8">dhcrelay6(8)</a>.
  <li>Respect checksum offloading for incoming UDP in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd.8">dhcpd(8)</a>.

  </ul>
</ul><!-- Routing daemons and other userland network improvements -->

<li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> improvements and bug fixes:
  <ul>
  <li>Fixed grey color in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a>.

  <li>Reworked <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> copy mode commands ("send-keys -X") to parse the arguments so that flags may be detected properly rather than just looking for strings ("-O" and so on). Also added -C and -P flags to the copy commands. -C prevents the commands from sending the text to the clipboard and -P prevents them from adding the text as a paste buffer.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> prompt-cursor-colour and prompt-cursor-style to set the style of the cursor in the command prompt and remove the emulated cursor.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> initial-repeat-time option to allow the first repeat time to be increased and later reduced.
  <li>Added a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> sixel_support format variable which is 1 if SIXEL is supported (always 0 on OpenBSD).
  <li>Allow control characters prefixed with C-v to be entered at the tmux.1 command prompt.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> support for a scrollbar at the side of each pane using new options pane-scrollbars, pane-scrollbars-positions and pane-scrollbars-styles.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> option to control the input buffer size.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> scrollbar mouse support.
  <li>Added a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> no-detach-on-destroy client option, useful for control mode clients.

  <li>Added a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> option allowing users to override the width of individual Unicode codepoints.
  <li>Fixed mouse_hyperlink format in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> copy mode.
  <li>Added S-Up and S-Down to move windows in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> tree mode.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> correctly skip wide characters in hyperlinks.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> only align panes and windows, not sessions.

    <li>Reworked CPU capabilities detection for amd64 and aarch64.
    <li>New SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512 assembly implementations for amd64.
      These make use of the SHA-NI instruction if it is available and
      replace the perl-generated assembly optimized for museum pieces.
      These are not yet enabled in libressl-portable.
    <li>New SHA-256 and SHA-512 assembly implementations for aarch64
      making use of the ARM Cryptographic Extension (CE). Not yet
      enabled in libressl-portable.

    <li>Imported ML-KEM 768 and 1024 from BoringSSL (not yet public API).
    </ul>
  <li>Compatibility changes
    <ul>
    <li>Added an OPENSSL_INIT_NO_ATEXIT flag for OPENSSL_init_crypto().
      It has no effect since LibreSSL doesn't call atexit().
    <li>Elliptic curve parameters are only accepted if they encode a
      built-in curve.
    <li>EC_METHOD is no longer public and the API exposing it has been
      removed. This includes EC_GROUP_new(), EC_GFp_mont_method(),
      EC_GROUP_method_of() and EC_METHOD_get_field_type().
    <li>The precomputation stubs for EC_GROUP were removed.

    <li>The tls_session_secret_cb_fn type now matches OpenSSL 1.1.
    <li>Unexport X509_NAME_print() and X509_OBJECT_up_ref_count().
    <li>const corrected UI_OpenSSL() and BN_MONT_CTX_copy().

    <li>Support SSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION and SSL_OP_ALLOW_CLIENT_RENEGOTIATION.
    <li>Export PKCS12_key_gen_uni() again.
    </ul>
  <li>New features
    <ul>
    <li>libtls has a new tls_peer_cert_common_name() API call to retrieve
      the peer's common name without having to inspect the PEM.
    </ul>

    <li>Fixed a few memory leaks in legacy code.
    </ul>
  <li>Documentation
    <ul>
    <li>The remaining undocumented public EVP API is now documented.
    <li>Reorganization of existing documentation for clarity and accuracy.
    </ul>
  <li>Testing and proactive security
    <ul>
    <li>Improved regress coverage of the EC code.
    </ul>
  </ul>

<li>OpenSSH 10.0
  <ul>
  <li>Security fixes
    <ul>
 
      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>:
      fix the DisableForwarding directive, which was failing
      to disable X11 forwarding and agent forwarding as documented.
      X11 forwarding is disabled by default in the server and agent
      forwarding is off by default in the client.
    </ul>
  <li>Potentially incompatible changes
    <ul>
    <li>This release removes support for the weak DSA signature
    algorithm, completing the deprecation process that began in
    2015 (when DSA was disabled by default) and repeatedly warned
    over the last 12 months.

    <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1'>scp(1)</a>, <a
    href='https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1'>sftp(1)</a>: pass "ControlMaster
    no" to ssh when invoked by scp &amp; sftp. This disables implicit
    session creation by these tools when ControlMaster was set to yes/auto
    by configuration, which some users found surprising. This change will
    not prevent scp/sftp from using an existing multiplexing session if
    one had already been created.

    <li>This release has the version number 10.0 and announces itself as
    "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_10.0". Software that naively matches versions using
    patterns like "OpenSSH_1*" may be confused by this.

     <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: this
     release removes the code responsible for the user authentication
     phase of the protocol from the per- connection sshd-session binary to
     a new sshd-auth binary.  Splitting this code into a separate binary
     ensures that the crucial pre-authentication attack surface has an
     entirely disjoint address space from the code used for the rest
     of the connection. It also yields a small runtime memory saving as
     the authentication code will be unloaded after the authentication
     phase completes. This change should be largely invisible to users,
     though some log messages may now come from "sshd-auth" instead of
     "sshd-session". Downstream distributors of OpenSSH will need to
     package the sshd-auth binary.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: this
      release disables finite field (a.k.a modp) Diffie-Hellman key
      exchange in sshd by default. Specifically, this removes the
      "diffie-hellman-group*" and "diffie-hellman-group-exchange-*"
      methods from the default KEXAlgorithms list. The client is unchanged
      and continues to support these methods by default. Finite field
      Diffie Hellman is slow and computationally expensive for the same
      security level as Elliptic Curve DH or PQ key agreement while
      offering no redeeming advantages. ECDH has been specified for
      the SSH protocol for 15 years and some form of ECDH has been the
      default key exchange in OpenSSH for the last 14 years.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: this
      release removes the implicit fallback to compiled- in groups for
      Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange KEX when the moduli file exists
      but does not contain moduli within the client- requested range.
      The fallback behaviour remains for the case where the moduli file
      does not exist at all. This allows administrators more explicit
      control over which DH groups will be selected, but can lead to
      connection failures if the moduli file is edited incorrectly.

    </ul>

  <li>New features
    <ul>

     <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>: the hybrid
     post-quantum algorithm mlkem768x25519-sha256
     is now used by default for key agreement. This algorithm is considered
     to be safe against attack by quantum computers, is guaranteed to
     be no less strong than the popular curve25519-sha256 algorithm,
     has been standardised by NIST and is considerably faster than the
     previous default.

     <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>: prefer AES-GCM
     to AES-CTR mode when selecting a cipher for the connection. The
     default cipher preference list is now Chacha20/Poly1305, AES-GCM
     (128/256) followed by AES-CTR (128/192/256).

     <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>: add %-token
     and environment variable expansion to the ssh_config SetEnv directive.

     <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>: allow %-token
     and environment variable expansion in the ssh_config User directive,
     with the exception of %r and %C which would be self-referential.

     <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>, <a
     href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: add "Match version"
     support to ssh_config and sshd_config. Allows matching on the local
     version of OpenSSH, e.g. "Match version OpenSSH_10.*".

     <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>: add support
     for "Match sessiontype" to ssh_config.  Allows matching on the type of
     session initially requested, either "shell" for interactive sessions,
     "exec" for command execution sessions, "subsystem" for subsystem
     requests, such as sftp, or "none" for transport/forwarding-only
     sessions.

     <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>: add support
     for "Match command ..." support to ssh_config, allowing matching on
     the remote command as specified on the command-line.

     <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>: allow 'Match
     tagged ""' and 'Match command ""' to match empty tag and command
     values respectively.

     <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: allow
     glob(3) patterns to be used in sshd_config AuthorizedKeysFile and
     AuthorizedPrincipalsFile directives.

     <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.1'>sshd(1)</a>: support the
     VersionAddendum in the client, mirroring the option of the same name
     in the server.

     <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1'>ssh-agent(1)</a>: the
     agent will now delete all loaded keys when signaled with SIGUSR1. This
     allows deletion of keys without having access to $SSH_AUTH_SOCK.

     <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1'>ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
     support FIDO tokens that return no attestation data, e.g. recent
     WinHello.

     <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1'>ssh-agent(1)</a>: add
     a "-Owebsafe-allow=..." option to allow the default FIDO application
     ID allow-list to be overridden.

     <li>Add a work-in-progress tool to verify FIDO attestation blobs
     that ssh-keygen can optionally write when enrolling FIDO keys.
     This tool is available under regress/misc/ssh-verify-attestation
     for experimentation but is not installed by "make install".

     <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1'>ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
     allow "-" as output file for moduli screening.

    </ul>
  <li>Bugfixes
    <ul>
      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: remove
      assumption that the sshd_config and any configs
      it includes can fit in a (possibly enlarged) socket buffer.  Previously
      it was possible to create a sufficiently large configuration
      that could cause sshd to fail to accept any connection. <a
      href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a> will now actively
      manage sending its config to the sshd-session sub-process.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>: don't start
      the ObscureKeystrokeTiming mitigations if there has been traffic
      on a X11 forwarding channel recently.  Should fix X11 forwarding
      performance problems when this setting is enabled.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>: prohibit the
      comma character in hostnames accepted, but allow an underscore as
      the first character in a hostname.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1'>sftp(1)</a>: set
      high-water when resuming a "put". Prevents bogus "server reordered
      acks" debug message.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>, <a
      href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: fix regression in
      openssh-9.8, which would fail to accept "Match criteria=argument" as
      well as the documented "Match criteria argument" syntax in ssh_config
      and sshd_config.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1'>sftp(1)</a>, <a
      href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>: fix a number possible
      NULL dereference bugs, including Coverity CIDs 405019 and 477813.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: fix
      PerSourcePenalty incorrectly using "crash" penalty when LoginGraceTime
      was exceeded.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: fix "Match
      invalid-user" from incorrectly being activated in initial configuration
      pass when no other predicates were present on the match line

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: fix debug
      logging of user specific delay.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: improve
      debug logging across sub-process boundaries.
      Previously some log messages were lost early in the sshd-auth and
      sshd-session processes' life.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>: require
      control-escape character sequences passed via the '-e ^x' command-line
      to be exactly two characters long. Avoids one byte out-of-bounds read
      if ssh is invoked as "ssh -e^ ..."

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>, <a
      href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: prevent integer
      overflow in x11 port handling.  These are theoretically possible if
      the admin misconfigured X11DisplayOffset or the user misconfigures
      their own $DISPLAY, but don't happen in normal operation.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1'>ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
      don't mess up ssh-keygen -l output when the file contains CR
      characters.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>:
      add rate limits to logging of connections dropped by
      PerSourcePenalties. Previously these could be noisy in logs.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>: fix argument
      of "Compression" directive in ssh -G config dump, which regressed
      in openssh-9.8.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: fix a
      corner-case triggered by UpdateHostKeys when sshd refuses to accept
      the signature returned by an agent holding host keys during the hostkey
      rotation sub-protocol. This situation could occur in situations where
      a PKCS#11 smartcard that lacked support for particular signature
      algorithms was used to store host keys.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1'>ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
      when using RSA keys to sign messages with "ssh-keygen -Y", select
      the signature algorithm based on the requested hash algorithm
      ("-Ohashalg=xxx"). This allows using something other than the default
      of rsa-sha2-512, which may not be supported on all signing backends,
      e.g. some smartcards only support SHA256.

      <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>,
      <a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>, <a
      href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1'>ssh-keyscan(1)</a>:
      fix ML-KEM768x25519 KEX on big-endian systems.

      <li>Many regression and interop test improvements.

Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.loongson for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/luna88k:</h3>

<p>
Copy 'boot' and 'bsd.rd' to a Mach or UniOS partition, and boot the bootloader
from the PROM, and then bsd.rd from the bootloader.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.luna88k for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, and power on your machine
while holding down the <i>C</i> key until the display turns on and
shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/7.7/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

<h3>OpenBSD/octeon:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, boot bsd.rd over the network via DHCP/tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.octeon for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/powerpc64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install77.img</i> or <i>miniroot77.img</i> to a
USB stick, plug it into the machine and choose the <i>OpenBSD
install</i> menu item in Petitboot.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.powerpc64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/riscv64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install77.img</i> or <i>miniroot77.img</i> to a
USB stick, and boot with that drive plugged in.
Make sure you also have the microSD card plugged in that shipped with the
HiFive Unmatched board.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.riscv64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy77.img</i> or <i>floppyB77.img</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>miniroot77.img</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 7.6 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade77.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.

<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.

<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr/ports</kbd>
# <kbd>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_7_7</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 7.7 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
