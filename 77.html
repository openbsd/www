  </ul>

<li>The following changes were made to the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> firewall:

<li>Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
<ul>
  <li>IPsec support was improved:
  <ul>
   <li>...
  </ul>

  <li>More RADIUS changes:
  <ul>
   <li>...
  </ul>

  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
  <li>Cache the Adj-RIB-Out for sessions that have not been down for
      more than 1h. This significantly improves synchronisation time
      of peers that flap.
  <li>Implement RFC 8538: Notification Message Support for
      BGP Graceful Restart.
  <li>Add support for RFC 8654, extended messages.
  <li>In bgplgd add additional endpoints to query the Adj-RIB-In and
      Adj-RIB-Out.
  <li>Bump internal message size limit to 128k and handle up to 10 000
      ASPA SPAS entries as suggested in draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile.
  <li>Various improvements to the ibuf API including a new reader API
      which is used to make all message parsing in bgpd memory safe.
  <li>Added support for IPsec and TCP MD5 to RTR sessions.
  <li>Improve default multiproto capability announcement selection.
      The default MP capability is only set if no other capability is
      configured on the neighbor.
  <li>The `reject as-set` configuration option now defaults to yes.
      Route announcements with AS_SET segments in the AS_PATH Attribute
      will be rejected. See draft-ietf-idr-deprecate-as-set-confed-set
      for more information.
  <li>The RFC 8654 Extended Message configuration changed from
      "announce extended (yes|no|enforce)" to
      "announce extended message (yes|no|enforce)"
  <li>RFC 8950 - Extended nexthop encoding support in the RIB.
  <li>Preliminary support for EVPN in the RIB.
  <li>When "transparent-as yes" is set, well-known BGP communities are
      passed on according to RFC 7947. This means that IX Route Servers
      transparently pass through NO_EXPORT, NO_ADVERTISE, etc.
  <li>Make the example bgpd.conf work out of the box with 4byte ASN.
  </ul>

  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpki-client.8">rpki-client(8)</a> saw
	these and more changes:
  <ul>
  <li>rpki-client 9.4 will gradually stop accepting ultra long-lived TA
  certificates. The utility now warns about TA certificates with an
  expiry date more than 15 years into the future. After February 2nd,
  2026, such certificates will be rejected, and from March 3rd 2027
  onwards, TA certificates with a validity period exceeding 3 years will
  be rejected. This is done to encourage reasonably frequent reissuance
  of TA certificates and ensures that changes in the SubjectInfoAccess
  and Internet Number Resources are propagated to the entire ecosystem.
  It also strengthens the mitigations for TA replay attacks introduced
  via the TA tie breaking mechanism. For further background see:
  https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/sidrops/-Y5NfXnGfDbeGOCAFj5xHgU90Zo/
  https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sidrops-rpki-ta-tiebreaker/
  <li>The generated BIRD config file was reworked. BIRD versions 1.x are no
  longer supported and the -T option to customize the ROA table name was
  removed. The config file now includes the ASPA-set by default and is
  therefore only compatible with BIRD 2.16 and later. If compatibility
  with older BIRD versions is required, the ASPA-set can be excluded
  with the -A flag. Operators should delete any remaining bird1v4 and
  bird1v6 output files.
  <li>Validated ROA payloads from AS0 TALs are by default excluded from the
  output files as they are not recommended for automatic filtering of
  BGP routes. This precaution can be overridden with the new -0 flag.
  <li>Various improvements to the ibuf API, including a new reader API
  which is used to make all message parsing in rpki-client memory safe.
  <li>Warn about gaps in manifest issuance. Such gaps can appear for example
  if rpki-client isn't run frequently enough, if there are issues with
  an RFC 8181 publication server or if there is an operational error on
  the side of the CA.
  <li>Work around a backward compatibility break accidentally introduced
  in OpenSSL 3.4.0, which resulted in all RPKI signed objects being
  rejected. Earlier and later versions of OpenSSL are not affected.
  <li>Improved validity period checking in file mode. The product's lifetime
  and the expiration time of the signature path are now taken into
  account.
  <li>Better cleanup in case of a fallback from RRDP to RSYNC. In rare
  circumstances, files were moved to the wrong place in the cache.
  <li>rpki-client now includes arin.tal which is no longer legally encumbered.
  See https://www.arin.net/announcements/20250116-tal/
  <li>rpki-client reports Certification Authorities that do not meaningfully 
  participate in the RPKI as non-functional CAs. By definition, a CA is
  non-functional if there is no currently valid Manifest. The number of
  such CAs is printed at the end of each run and more detailed information
  is available in the JSON (-j) and ometrics (-m) output.
  <li>Fix a problem where incorrect internal RRDP state handling in
  rpki-client could lead to a denial of service.
  <li>Termination of rsync child processes with SIGTERM is no longer treated as
  an error if rpki-client has sent this signal. This only affects openrsync.
  <li>Do not exit filemode with an error if a .gbr or a .tak object contains
  control characters in its UTF-8 strings. Instead, only warn and emit a
  sanitized version in JSON output.

or boot bsd.rd via tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.loongson for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/luna88k:</h3>

<p>
Copy 'boot' and 'bsd.rd' to a Mach or UniOS partition, and boot the bootloader
from the PROM, and then bsd.rd from the bootloader.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.luna88k for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, and power on your machine
while holding down the <i>C</i> key until the display turns on and
shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/7.7/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

<h3>OpenBSD/octeon:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, boot bsd.rd over the network via DHCP/tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.octeon for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/powerpc64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install77.img</i> or <i>miniroot77.img</i> to a
USB stick, plug it into the machine and choose the <i>OpenBSD
install</i> menu item in Petitboot.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.powerpc64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/riscv64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install77.img</i> or <i>miniroot77.img</i> to a
USB stick, and boot with that drive plugged in.
Make sure you also have the microSD card plugged in that shipped with the
HiFive Unmatched board.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.riscv64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy77.img</i> or <i>floppyB77.img</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>miniroot77.img</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 7.6 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the

<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.

<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr/ports</kbd>
# <kbd>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_7_7</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 7.7 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
