"OpenBSD is often unjustly overlooked as a free UNIX-like system in favour of
the more-hyped Linux. While it receives a lot less publicity than other
operating systems, this is not due to lack of technical merit." says David
Chisnall, in what is a clear and concise overview of the new features
in 3.7 and indeed the project as a whole.

What are the real vulnerabilities of Linux?</a>
NewsForge.com, December 6, 2004</strong></font><br>
Several security consultants were asked about "the real vulnerabilities of
Linux". Cybersoure CEO Con Symaris seems to get it better than the rest:
"One needs to approach security as a prime requirement and motivator,
much as the OpenBSD team do," Zymaris said... "The Linux
community mindset is different. Linux development is dynamic and
races ahead towards more and broader functionality, drawing a
multitude of interested parties in to make interesting extensions
and adaptations at a rapid rate."
<p>
"In order to do security the BSD way, however, much more effort
needs to be spent auditing code for holes, which is much less sexy,
and attracts a different set of coders," Zymaris added.

Closed Source Hardware</a>
Security Focus, December 1, 2004</strong></font><br>
Symantec Threat Analyst Jason Miller analyzes the potential security threats
when hardware vendors won't provide device documentation and
instead provide "binary only" driver code for inclusion in open source
operating systems.
Miller is an open-source fan who says he uses a variety of systems, including
OpenBSD on his firewall.
Of the recent trend to closed-source binary drivers for open-source
systems, he writes:
<blockquote>
The closed-source component required to support this hardware is
completely independent of the associated operating system, and as
such, is also independent of the engineering team, security team,
auditing process, and quality control procedures normally related
to the operating system...
<br/>
What's possibly even more disturbing is that we're talking about
a chunk of code in the operating system, running with the highest
possible level of privilege (the kernel), which is supplied by a
third-party vendor. This code could do anything once loaded, including
leaking active WEP keys, gathering usage statistics, sniffing and
disclosing traffic, and it could even introduce a subtle backdoor
into the operating system itself (much the same as any device driver
in a closed source operating system).
<br/>
[A]lthough some of these scenarios are a
little far-fetched, the possibility for them to exist is there...
Ultimately it becomes an issue of trust, which is a cornerstone of 
good security: whom do you trust, and how much do you trust them?
</blockquote>
<p>And he comments that trust "seems to be a one-way street": vendors
demand that you trust them, but they won't trust you to know how
their hardware and software operates.
This lack of trust is one reason why OpenBSD has recently completed
reverse-engineering the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ath&apropos=0&sektion=4">
Atheros wireless chipset driver</a>
that was originally provided as a binary insert.

"will be even more important as multicore processors--which occupy space

Theo recounts the struggle to get Intel to provide redistributable
versions of the firmware for their wireless chipsets, and their
ultimate refusal to allow OpenBSD to redistribute the chipsets' firmware.
Includes a caveat about Intel's disingenuous "FAQ", typical of many

A snide answer is OpenBSD, which has an exemplary record with respect to

Microsoft's hired analysts claim that Windows is more secure than Linux.
Should we believe them?"

Not surprisingly, the answer is in the negative. 
Good discussion on why Microsoft's OS is still not really secure.

Report on Lok Technologies and its founder Simon Lok, a 26-year-old with three
Masters degrees and most of a PhD. Lok's current product is a box for
Wireless ISPs (WISPs) that includes registration, administration, 
routing/firewall, and more.
Of course the "Airlok" is based on OpenBSD.
J. Russ Grant, technical manager at American Airlines, likes the Airlok:
<blockquote>because it takes a "tough love" approach; when it spots a virus 
on a computer, it automatically blocks that machine, "blackholing" the user,
and notifies Grant...  "The Airlok has the best firewall I have ever seen,"
says Grant, who believes the product could even change the Web itself.
"Imagine if Comcast or other ISPs started using Airloks. 
If someone got a virus, the system would just shut that person down 
before it could spread. This could make hackers obsolete."
</blockquote>
Maybe a bit of hyperbole, but the product does look good, and serves
as an example of what you can do with OpenBSD as a base.

"I view OpenBSD as the most secure operating system available. It
certainly has far fewer holes than Windows, and fewer than any
flavor of Linux I've looked at...
Most of the chapters (e.g., XWindow, DNS, etc.) are very fine; the
emphasis on security is thorough and well-instantiated. The frequent
code examples are appropriate and enlightening. On an information
level, Palmer and Nazario are very good."
His only criticisms have to do with production issues: incomplete copy editing
by the publisher leading to un-explained acronyms, poor cross-referencing
and even spelling/wording errors.
Overall he seems to like the book (and the operating system, of course).

This write-up of OpenBSD's new Common Address Redundancy Protocol (CARP)

it does: CARP provides sharing
of an IP address among several hosts on the same network to provide
failover and limited load balancing. Gives enough technical

Quote: "Some of you with highly redundant and fault-tolerant hardware
may think CARP won't help you. Think again...
think of how nice it would be to patch and reboot during normal
business hours instead of at 2 a.m. Think about not having to balance
doing system upgrades against taking an entire building offline.
Think about hot-testing new technologies while knowing that, if

The official announcement of the 3.3 release lists all the great things 
that have been added
to the system in 3.3, including ProPolice, W^X, fewer setuid/setgid programs,
more privsep, major security and usability improvements in pf,
more hardware support including the HPPA platform, spamd, more and better
third-party "ports", many upgrades to included software, and more.
Recommends purchase of CD and T-shirts to provide continuing funding
for the project (more so now that the DARPA funding is gone).
As always, OpenBSD remains free software, so you can FTP it for free.

</strong></font><br>
Another take on the ongoing saga, with some interesting remarks:
Reporter Jennifer Lee comments that the controversy
"highlights the delicate balance between the military and the
anti-establishment bent of some in the technology community. It
also shows that the international pool of computer programmers and
hackers, possessing vast technological expertise, is not entirely
sympathetic to the American military's current role in world
affairs." Notes the discrepancy between DARPA's public position
and what the people working on the UPenn project have been told.
<br/>
Describes Theo de Raadt as "A respected Canadian computer programmer ...
the 35-year-old founder of an international collaborative software project 
known as OpenBSD", and quotes him as saying that the hackathon will go on:
"We are free people, we are hobbyists," he said. "We do this for fun."

from DARPA is quoted as saying "We're sorry if this review process has
been misinterpreted as an effort to cancel the work."  (If it was not
a cancellation, then why did Mark West from UPENN phone the Hyatt
Calgary and cancel the reservations -- even before OpenBSD was
informed by Jonathan Smith, who in email said "Penn has been contacted
by the Air Force and NO FURTHER COSTS MAY BE INCURRED, effective
today, 4/17/03", "All subcontracts are terminated, effective TODAY",
and "Penn must cancel/terminate contracts &amp; obligations such as the
Hyatt and travel not yet PAID. Mark, please carry this out ASAP per

A description of the work done in 3.3 to prevent buffer overflow attacks.
The editors speak strongly in favor of the team's efforts
in producing reliable, bug-free software; 
quoting two of them:
<br/>(Ranum): It's GREAT to see that at least a few people are smart enough
to try to attack problems like this systemically, rather than keeping
stuck in the fruitless "penetrate and patch" while loop. This is how
to make progress in security: fundamental protections.
<br/>(Shpantzer): Initiatives like this should be taught as case studies
in computer science courses at the undergraduate level.

DARPA Awards Computer Scientists $2.1 Million to Integrate Security Features into Mainstream Computers</a>.
</strong></font><br>
The original announcement from the University of Pennsylvania about
the cooperative effort with OpenBSD et al with DARPA funding:
"During the last few decades, the government's approach has been
to contract researchers to develop high-security workstations
specifically for its own uses, outside of the mainstream computer
industry," said [Prof. Jonathan] Smith, Professor of Computer and Information 
Science at Penn.  "The problem is that development of these special-purpose
computers has generally progressed so slowly that the machines,
while indeed secure, are technically obsolete by the time they are
put into service."
<p>
"Smith and colleagues at Penn, the software development consortium
OpenBSD, and the Apache Software Foundation and OpenSSL Group
propose to use the open-source movement - where programmers openly
share incremental advances - to try to engineer better security
features into mainstream computers, not only those developed just
for the military and other high-security organizations.  The
government then benefits by purchasing more affordable, standardized
computers with security features."

big-lie-hyping the threat of system crackers into a new force to be
made war upon, like the "war" on drugs and the "war" on terrorism.
Concludes: "... the bulk of the report's solutions are lame. Most
are meaningless jargon, such as suggesting that "future components
of the cyber infrastructure are built to be inherently secure and
dependable for their users." A fantastic sentiment, but as mushy
as stating that the president is "for the children." What about
making software vendors liable for bug-ridden products? Or rooting
out insecure Microsoft products like the troubled SQL server in favor 
of more secure open-source solutions like

I can scarcely believe that Slate's owner Microsoft is paying 
them to write this stuff (nor that Koerner thinks OpenBSD is a database :-)).
Finally: "Nothing so bold is forthcoming in the Strategy. Which is
yet another indicator that the czars of national computer security
are perfectly content to tease out the hyperbole in perpetuity.

MITRE Report Number MP 02 W0000101, revised January 2, 2003
</strong></font><br>
Prepared by The MITRE Corporation for DISA (Defense Information Systems Agency),
this report analyses how DOD uses open source software.
The summary talks briefly about various terms (free, open source, etc.),
then talks about the survey itself, one question of which was 
"... the hypothetical question ...
of what would happen if FOSS software were banned in the DoD."
<br>
"The main conclusion of the analysis was that FOSS software plays
a more critical role in the DoD than has generally been recognized.
FOSS applications are most important in four broad areas: Infrastructure
Support, Software Development, Security, and Research. One unexpected
result was the degree to which Security depends on FOSS. Banning
FOSS would remove certain types of infrastructure components (e.g.,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>) that currently help 
support network security. 
It would also limit DoD access to, and overall expertise in, the use of 
powerful FOSS analysis and detection applications that hostile groups could
use to help stage cyberattacks. Finally, it would remove the
demonstrated ability of FOSS applications to be updated rapidly in
response to new types of cyberattack. Taken together, these factors
imply that banning FOSS would have immediate, broad, and strongly
negative impacts on the ability of many sensitive and security-focused
DoD groups to defend against cyberattacks."
<br>
So, let's hope the policy wonks read this report.

By Tom Yager.  In a comparison of the BSD-derived systems with
those based in the Linux kernel, the author underlines the
stability and security strengths of the BSDs.  He brands
OpenBSD as the <em>cop</em> of the group, remarking the fact
that <em>&quot;has never been breached to allow privileged
access to an OpenBSD server&quot;</em>.

Kurt Seifried talks about what people can do to promote security and
protect themselves against the now-commonplace attacks. His first
suggestion is for software vendors to audit code like OpenBSD did, but he
feels that the effort and demand for knowledgeable programmers is too
great for this approach to succeed. Instead, he suggests add-ons such as
various Linux patches, development tools and replacement libraries. We
think he gave up too easily: by accepting mudflaps in the place of
airbags, he is taking the heat off software vendors to clean up the
defects in their products.
