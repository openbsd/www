<h3>What's New</h3>
<p>
This is a partial list of new features and systems included in OpenBSD 7.5.
For a comprehensive list, see the <a href="plus75.html">changelog</a> leading <!-- plus? XXX -->
to 7.5.

<ul>

<!--
<li>New/extended platforms:
  <ul>
  <li>...
  </ul>
-->

<li>Various kernel improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bt.5">bt(5)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/btrace.8">btrace(8)</a> support for
	binary modulo operator ('%').
  <li>Added a TIMEOUT_MPSAFE flag to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/timeout.9">timeout(9)</a>.
  <li>Added IBM encoded version of the "Spleen 8x16" font, usable as console font.
  <li>Cleanup and machine-independent refactoring of three context
	switch paths outside of mi_switch(): when a process forks and the new
	proc needs to be scheduled by proc_trampoline, cpu_hatch: when booting
	APs, and sched_exit: when a proc exits.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vscsi.4">vscsi(4)</a>
	'vscsi_filtops' mpsafe and extended the 'sc_state_mtx' <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/mutex.9">mutex(9)</a> to protect
	'sc_klist' knotes list.
  <li>Made out-of-swap checking more robust, preventing potential deadlocks.
  <li>Eliminated the ioctl whitelist that <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/bio.4">bio(4)</a> will tunnel for other
	devices, allowing bio to be used with other (non-raid) related
	devices.
  <li>On msdos filesystems, ensure that a complete struct fsinfo is read
	even if the filesystem sectors are smaller.
  <li>Implemented per-CPU caching for the page table page (vp) pool and
	the PTE descriptor (pted) pool in the arm64 pmap implementation. This
	significantly reduces the side-effects of lock contention on the
	kernel map lock and leads to significant speedups on machines with
	many CPU cores.
  <li>Implemented <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acpi.4">acpi(4)</a>
	RootPathString support in the LoadTable() AML function, fixing OpenBSD
	boot on an older version of Hyper-V.
  <li>Fixed Linux NFS clients freezing after five minutes of inactivity.
  <li>Fixed core file writing when a file map into memory has later been
	truncated to be smaller than the mapping.
  <li>Disallow <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/madvise.2">madvise(2)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/msync.2">msync(2)</a> memory/mapping
	destructive operations on immutable memory regions. Instead return EPERM.
  <li>Added new amd64-only sysctl machdep.retpoline which says whether
	the cpu requires the retpoline branch target injection mitigation.
  <li>Added new accounting flag ABTCFI to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/acct.5">acct(5)</a> to indicate SIGILL +
	code ILL_BTCFI has occurred in the process.
  </ul>

<li>SMP Improvements
  <ul>
  <li>Some network timers run without kernel lock.
  <li>TCP syn cache timer runs with shared net lock.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bind.2">bind(2)</a>
	and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/connect.2">connect(2)</a>
	system calls can run in parallel.
  <li>Packet counter for <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/lo.4">lo(4)</a> loopback
	interface are MP safe.
  <li>Split protocol control block table for UDP into IPv4
	and IPv6 tables to allow concurrent access.
  <li>UDP packets can be sent in parallel by multiple threads.
  </ul>

<li>Direct Rendering Manager and graphics drivers
  <ul>
  <li>Updated <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/drm.4">drm(4)</a>
      to Linux 6.6.19.
  <li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/arm64/apldcp.4">apldcp(4)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/arm64/apldrm.4">apldrm(4)</a> drivers
      for Apple display coprocessor.

<li>VMM/VMD improvements
  <ul>
  <li>Fixed IRQ storm caused by edge-triggered devices such as the UART.
  <li>Fixed block size calculation for vioscsi devices.
  <li>Added io instruction length to vm exit information, allowing

  <li>Added <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/mkdtemps.3">mkdtemps(3)</a>, identical
	to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mkdtemp.3">mkdtemp(3)</a> except
	that it permits a suffix to exist in the template.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mktemp.1">mktemp(1)</a>
	suffix support for compatibility with the GNU version. It is now
	possible to use templates where the Xs are not at the end.
  </ul>

  <li>Prevented <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a>
	'flag' from altering other GPT partition attributes when flagging a
	partition as the only bootable partition.
  <li>Allow <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a> to
	add GPT partitions of protected types, making it possible to provision
	virtual machine images that need a "BIOS Boot" partition.

  <li>Added group handling matching <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/fbtab.5">fbtab(5)</a> to xenodm.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/grep.1">grep(1)</a> -m behavior match GNU grep.
  <li>Tweaked the default memory limits in /etc/login.conf on several
	architectures to account for increased memory requirements, for

	SIGHUP at boot.
  <li>Changed <a
        href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.so.1">ld.so(1)</a> to only load the first libc version encountered
	requested and substituting it for all further loads, ensuring that the
	libc version requested by an executable itself is the one loaded.
  <li>Significantly (for small programs) reduce the size of statically
	linked binaries by splitting several libc internal functions into
	separate compilation and thus linkage units. Specifically <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/getpwnam.3">getpwnam(3)</a> does not
	need the full YP socket setup and does not use all possible <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/dbopen.3">dbopen(3)</a> database
	backends.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vi.1">vi(1)</a>

  firmware image on some devices.
  <li>Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bfwm.4">bwfm(4)</a> work with MAC
  addresses set via ifconfig lladdr.
  <li>Ensure that <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm.4">iwm(4)</a> uses the
  80MHz primary channel index announced in beacons.
  <li>Avoid using MCS-9 in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm.4">iwm(4)</a>
  Tx rate selection if 40 MHz is disabled to prevent firmware errors.
  <li>Ensure that <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm.4">iwm(4)</a> and
  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwx.4">iwx(4)</a> devices announce VHT
  capabilities in probe requests.
  <li>Fix bug in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm.4">iwm(4)</a>,
  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwx.4">iwx(4)</a>, and
  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwn.4">iwn(4)</a> which could result

<li>Installer, upgrade and bootloader improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>Add support for disk encryption in unattended installations with
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/autoinstall.8">autoinstall(8)</a>,
	both with a plaintext passphrase or a keydisk.
  <li>Removed default sets answer in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/autoinstall.8">autoinstall(8)</a>
	response file such that it now populates only with non-defaults.
  <li>Made <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/fw_update.8">fw_update(8)</a> verify but
	not overwrite SHA256.sig.
  <li>Improved <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/fw_update.8">fw_update(8)</a> output on
	errors and improved ftp error handling.
  <li>Added support in the installer to encrypt the root disk with a key disk.
  <li>Prevent re-starting the automatic upgrade on octeon and
	powerpc64, as is already done on other platforms.
  <li>Added CD install images to arm64.
  <li>Make the amd64 cdXX.iso and installXX.iso CD images bootable in
	EFI mode (by creating an EFI system partition containing the EFI boot
	loaders to be installed as an El Torito boot image).
  </ul>

<li>Security improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>Introduce pinsyscalls(2): The kernel and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.so.1">ld.so(1)</a> register the
	precise entry location of every system call used by a program, as
	described in the new ELF section .openbsd.syscalls inside ld.so and
	libc.so. ld.so uses the new syscall <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscalls.2">pinsyscalls(2)</a> to
	tell the kernel the precise entry location of system calls in
	libc.so.<br>
      Attempting to use a different system call entry instruction to
	perform a non-corresponding system call operation will fail and the
	process will be terminated with signal SIGABRT.
  <li>Removed support for <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/syscall.2">syscall(2)</a>, the
	"indirection system call," a dangerous alternative entry point for all
	system calls.<br>
      Together with <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscalls.2">pinsyscalls(2)</a> this
	change makes it impossible to perform system call through any other
	way than the libc system call wrapper functions.<br>
      Users of syscall(2), such as Perl and the Go programming
	language were converted to use the libc functions.
  <li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2">pledge(2)</a>
	stdio before parsing pfkey messages to <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsecctl.8">ipsecctl(8)</a> -m and -s.
  <li>Tightened the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2">pledge(2)</a> in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pax.1">pax(1)</a> in List and Append
	modes.
  <li>Created __OpenBSD versions of llvm cxa guard implementation
	using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/futex.2">futex(2)</a> with the
	correct number of arguments and without using <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/syscall.2">syscall(2)</a>.
  <li>Improvements in Pointer Authentication (PAC) and Branch Target
	Identification (BTI) on arm64.
  </ul>

<li>Changes in the network stack:
  <ul>
  <li>Enable IPv6 support in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ppp.4">ppp(4)</a>
  <li>Socket with sequenced packet type and control messages
	handle end of record correctly.
  <li>The routing table has a generation number.  That means
	cached routes at sockets will be invalidated when the routing
	table changes.  Especially with dynamic routing daemons
	local connections use the up to date route.
  <li>Route cache hits an misses are printed in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/netstat.1">netstat(1)</a>
	statistics.  
  <li>Prevented <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wg.4">wg(4)</a>
	getting stuck on peer destruction.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/umb.4">umb(4)</a> delete any
	existing v4 address before setting a new one, allowing keeping of a
	working default route when the address changes.
  <li>Forwarded TCP LRO disabling to parent devices and disabled TCP LR0
	on bridged <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vlan.4">vlan(4)</a> and
	default for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bpe.4">bpe(4)</a>, <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/nvgre.4">nvgre(4)</a> and <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/vxlan.4">vxlan(4)</a>.
  <li>Fixed race between <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a> destroy of
	an interface and the ARP timer.
  <li>Added statistics counters for the route cache, reporting cache
	hits and misses. This is shown in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/netstat.1">netstat(1)</a> with
	<code>netstat -s</code>.
  </ul>

<li>The following changes were made to the <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> firewall:
  <ul>
  <li>tcpdump on <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pflog.4">pflog(4)</a> interface shows
	packets dropped by the default rule with the "block" action.  Although
	the default rules is a "pass" rule, it blocks malformed packets.  Now
	this is correctly logged.
  <li>Adjustments to keep up firewall aware of MP related changes in
	the network stack.
  <li>Fix handling of multiple <code>-K</code>(<code>-k</code>) options in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl.8">pfctl(8)</a>, so behavior
	matches what's described in manual.
  <li>Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl.8">pfctl(8)</a> show
	all tables in all anchors with <code>pfctl -a "*" -sT</code>.
  <li>Added check to ensure <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl.8">pfctl(8)</a> -f won't accept a
	directory and install an empty ruleset.
  <li>Added validation for IPv4 packet options in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/divert.4">divert(4)</a>.
  </ul>

<li>Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
<ul>
  <li>IPsec support was improved:
  <ul>
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> always
	prefer group from the initial KE payload as responder if supported.
  <li>Corrected renewal of expired certificates in <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>.
  <li>Added an <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>
	debug message when no policy is found.
  <li>Implemented a per connection peerid for <a
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a> control replies.
  <li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>
	trigger retransmission only for fragment 1/x to prevent each received
	fragment triggering retransmission of the full fragment queue.
  <li>Prevent routing loops by dropping already encrypted packets that are going through <a 
	href="https://man.openbsd.org/sec.4">sec(4)</a> again.
  </ul>

  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
    <li>Rewrite the internal message passing mechanism to use a new
	memory-safe API.
    <li>Rewrite most protocol parsers to use the new memory-safe API.
	Convert the UPDATE parser, all of RTR, as well as both the MRT dump
	code in bgpd and the parser in bgpctl.
    <li>Improve RTR logging, error handling and version negotiation.
  </ul>

  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpki-client.8">rpki-client(8)</a> saw these and more changes:
  <ul>
	<li>Add ability to constrain an RPKI Trust Anchor's effective signing
	authority to a limited set of Internet numbers. This allows Relying
	Parties to enjoy the potential benefits of assuming trust, but within
	a bounded scope.
	<li>Following a 'failed fetch' (described in RFC 9286), emit a warning and
	continue with a previously cached Manifest file.
	<li>Emit a warning when the remote repository presents a Manifest with an
	unexpected manifestNumber.
	<li>Improved CRL extension checking.
	<li>Experimental support for the P-256 signature algorithm.
	<!-- 8.8. -->
	<li>A failed manifest fetch could result in a NULL pointer dereference or
	a use after free.
	<li>Reject non-conforming RRDP delta elements that contain neither publish
	nor a withdraw element and fall back to the RRDP snapshot.
	<li>Refactoring and minor bug fixes in the warning display functions.
	<!-- 8.9 -->
	<li>The handling of manifests fetched via rsync or RRDP was reworked to
	fully conform to RFC 9286.
	<li>Fix a race condition between closing an idle connection and scheduling a
	new request on it.
	<li>The evaluation time specified with -P now also applies to trust anchor
	certificates.
	<li>Check that the entire CMS eContent was consumed. Previously, trailing
	data would be silently discarded on deserialization of products.
	<li>In file mode do not consider overclaiming intermediate CA certificates
	as invalid.  OAA warning is still issued.
	<li>Print the revocation time of certificates in file mode.
	<li>Be more careful when converting OpenSSL numeric identifiers (NIDs)
	to strings.
	<!-- 9.0 -->
	<li>Added support for RPKI Signed Prefix Lists.
	<li>Added an -x flag to opt into parsing and evaluation of file types that are
	still considered experimental.
	<li>Added a metric to track the number of new files that were moved to the
	validated cache.
	<li>Ensure that the FileAndHashes list in a Manifest contains no duplicate
	file names and no duplicate hashes.
  </ul>

  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
	<li>Add <code>Message-Id</code> as needed for messages received on
	    the submission port.
	<li>Added support for RFC 7505 "Null MX" handling and treat
	    an MX of "localhost" as it were a "Null MX".
	<li>Allow inline tables and filter listings in
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.conf.5">smtpd.conf(5)</a>
	    to span over multiple lines.
	<li>Enabled <abbr title="Delivery Status Notification">DSN</abbr>
	    for the implicit socket too.
	<li>Added the
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.conf.5#no-dsn~2">no-dsn</a>
	    option for <code>listen on socket</code> too.
	<li>Reject headers that start with a space or a tab.
	<li>Fixed parsing of the <code>ORCPT</code> parameter.
	<li>Fixed table lookups of IPv6 addresses.
	<li>Fixed handling of escape characters in To, From and Cc headers.
	<li>Run <abbr title="Local Mail Transfer Protocol">LMTP</abbr>
	    deliveries as the recipient user again.
	<li>Disallow custom commands and file reading in root's
	    <code>.forward</code> file.
	<li>Do not process other users <code>.forward</code> files when
	    an alternate delivery user is provided in a dispatcher.
	<li>Unify the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/table.5">table(5)</a>
	    parser used in
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a> and
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/makemap.8">makemap(8)</a>.
	<li>Allow to use <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/table.5">table(5)</a>
	    mappings on various match constraints.
  </ul>
<!-- OTHER -->
  <li>Many other changes in various network programs and libraries:
  <ul>
<!-- syslogd -->
        <li>If a DNS name is configured as remote syslog server,
	  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/syslogd.8">syslogd(8)</a>
	  retries to resolve the loghost name periodically until it succeeds.
	  UDP packets that get lost during that period are counted and
	  logged later.
	<li>Added counting of dropped UDP packets to <a
	  href="https://man.openbsd.org/syslogd.8">syslogd(8)</a>.

	  log output to stderr and '-v' option to make this output more verbose.
	<li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpd.8">dhcpd(8)</a>, made <a
	  href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcp-options.5">dhcp-options(5)</a>
	  recognize option ipv6-only-preferred (RFC8925).
	<li>Allowed <a
	  href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcpleased.8">dhcpleased(8)</a> to
	  request "IPv6-only preferred" and deconfigure IPv4 on the interface if
	  the server replies with this option.
<!-- more -->
	<li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/radiusd.8">radiusd(8)</a>
	  to properly fixup MPPE-{Send,Recv}-Key and Tunnel-Password attributes of the
	  response.
	<li>Added nochroot parameter to <a
	  href="https://man.openbsd.org/radiusd.8">radiusd(8)</a>
	  module_drop_privilege() so that modules can use <a
	  href="https://man.openbsd.org/unveil.2">unveil(2)</a> instead of <a
	  href="https://man.openbsd.org/chroot.2">chroot(2)</a> if needed.
	<li>Ensured correct denominators when converting NTP fixed point
	  values to double and vice-versa in <a
	  href="https://man.openbsd.org/ntpd.8">ntpd(8)</a>.

	  AI_CANONNAME or AI_FQDN is set.
	<li>Added <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a>
	  support for specifying ports on the src address in tunnel endpoints of
	  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/gif.4">gif(4)</a>, <a
	  href="https://man.openbsd.org/gre.4">gre(4)</a> and related
	  tunnel interfaces.
	<li>Added an <a
	  href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a> endpoint
	  command for "bridges" that use addresses as endpoints, usable to add
	  static entries on interfaces like <a
	  href="https://man.openbsd.org/vxlan.4">vxlan(4)</a>.
	<li>Tightened up <a
	  href="https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.8">relayd(8)</a> HTTP header parsing.
	<li>Deferred <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.8">relayd(8)</a>
	  relay_read_http header parsing until after line continuation,
	  preventing potential request smuggling attacks.
	<li>Improved <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a>
	  auto-index, adding human-readable file sizes and allowing per-column
	  sorting.

    </ul>
  </ul>

<li>OpenSSH 9.6 and OpenSSH 9.7
  <ul>
  <li>Security fixes
    <ul>
    <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>, <a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: implement protocol extensions to thwart the
       so-called "Terrapin attack" discovered by Fabian Bäumer, Marcus
       Brinkmann and Jörg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a
       limited break of the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport
       protocol by sending extra messages prior to the commencement of
       encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages
       immediately after encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server
       would not be able to detect that messages were deleted.
    
       <br>While cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack
       is fortunately very limited as it only allows deletion of
       consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of
       the protocol prevents user authentication from proceeding and
       results in a stuck connection.
    
       <br>The most serious identified impact is that it lets a MITM to
       delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication
       starts, allowing the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke
       timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5. There is no
       other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity.
    
    <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1'>ssh-agent(1)</a>: when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while
       specifying destination constraints, if the PKCS#11 token returned
       multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied.
       Use of regular private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys
       are unaffected.

    <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>: if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell
       metacharacters was passed to <a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>, and a ProxyCommand,
       LocalCommand directive or "match exec" predicate referenced the
       user or hostname via %u, %h or similar expansion token, then
       an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to <a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>
       could potentially perform command injection depending on what
       quoting was present in the user-supplied <a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5'>ssh_config(5)</a> directive.
    
       <br>OpenSSH 9.6 now
       bans most shell metacharacters from user and hostnames supplied
       via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be
       effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for <a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a> to
       universally filter shell metacharacters potentially relevant to
       user-supplied commands.
    
       <br>User/hostnames provided via <a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5'>ssh_config(5)</a> are not subject to these
       restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to
       continue to be used, under the assumption that the user knows what
       they are doing in their own configuration files.
    </ul>
  <li>New features
    <ul>
    <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1'>ssh(1)</a>, <a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: add a "global" ChannelTimeout type that watches
       all open channels and will close all open channels if there is no
       traffic on any of them for the specified interval. This is in
       addition to the existing per-channel timeouts added recently.
    <br>This supports situations like having both session and x11
       forwarding channels open where one may be idle for an extended
       period but the other is actively used. The global timeout could
       close both channels when both have been idle for too long.
    
    <li>All: make DSA key support compile-time optional, defaulting to on.
    </ul>
  <li>Bugfixes
    <ul>
    <li><a href='https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8'>sshd(8)</a>: don't append an unnecessary space to the end of subsystem

<section id=quickinstall>
<p>
Quick installer information for people familiar with OpenBSD, and the use of
the "<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel</a> -E" command.
If you are at all confused when installing OpenBSD, read the relevant
INSTALL.* file as listed above!

<h3>OpenBSD/alpha:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install75.iso</i> or
<i>cd75.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/amd64:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install75.iso</i> or
<i>cd75.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install75.img</i> or
<i>miniroot75.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included
INSTALL.amd64 document.

<p>
If you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.amd64.

<h3>OpenBSD/arm64:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install75.iso</i> or
<i>cd75.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.

<p>
To boot from disk, write <i>install75.img</i> or <i>miniroot75.img</i> to a
disk and boot from it after connecting to the serial console.  Refer to
INSTALL.arm64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/armv7:</h3>

<p>
Write a system specific miniroot to an SD card and boot from it after connecting
to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.armv7 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/hppa:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network by following the instructions in INSTALL.hppa or the
<a href="hppa.html#install">hppa platform page</a>.

<h3>OpenBSD/i386:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install75.iso</i> or
<i>cd75.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

<p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install75.img</i> or
<i>miniroot75.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

<p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in
the included INSTALL.i386 document.

<p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.i386.

<h3>OpenBSD/landisk:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot75.img</i> to the start of the CF
or disk, and boot normally.

<h3>OpenBSD/loongson:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot75.img</i> to a USB stick and boot bsd.rd from it
or boot bsd.rd via tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.loongson for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/luna88k:</h3>

<p>
Copy 'boot' and 'bsd.rd' to a Mach or UniOS partition, and boot the bootloader
from the PROM, and then bsd.rd from the bootloader.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.luna88k for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, and power on your machine
while holding down the <i>C</i> key until the display turns on and
shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/7.5/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

<h3>OpenBSD/octeon:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, boot bsd.rd over the network via DHCP/tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.octeon for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/powerpc64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install75.img</i> or <i>miniroot75.img</i> to a
USB stick, plug it into the machine and choose the <i>OpenBSD
install</i> menu item in Petitboot.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.powerpc64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/riscv64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install75.img</i> or <i>miniroot75.img</i> to a
USB stick, and boot with that drive plugged in.
Make sure you also have the microSD card plugged in that shipped with the
HiFive Unmatched board.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.riscv64 for more details.

<h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy75.img</i> or <i>floppyB75.img</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>miniroot75.img</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 7.4 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="faq/upgrade75.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.
</section>

<hr>

<section id=sourcecode>
<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.
</section>

<hr>

<section id=ports>
<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
<blockquote><pre>
# <kbd>cd /usr/ports</kbd>
# <kbd>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_7_5</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 7.5 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
