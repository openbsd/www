<hr>
<p>
    This is a list of software and ideas developed or maintained by the OpenBSD
    project, sorted in order of approximate introduction. Some of them are
    explained in detail in our <a href="events.html">research papers</a>.

<h3>Concepts</h3>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsec.4">ipsec(4)</a>:
	Started by John Ioannidis, Angelos D. Keromytis, Niels Provos, and
	Niklas Hallqvist, imported February 20, 1997.  OpenBSD was the first
	free operating system to provide an IPSec stack.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/inet6.4">inet6(4)</a>:
	First complete integration and adoption of IPv6 led by
	"Itojun" (Dr. Junichiro Hagino) [WIDE/KAME], Craig Metz [NRL], and
	Angelos D. Keromytis starting Jan 6, 1999.
	Almost fully operational Jun 6, 1999 during the
	<a href="hackathons.html">first OpenBSD hackathon</a>.
	OpenBSD 2.7.
    <li><strong>Privilege separation</strong>:
	First implemented by
	<a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html">Niels Provos</a>
	and Markus Friedl in OpenSSH in March 2002, released with OpenBSD 3.2.
	The concept is now used in many OpenBSD programs, for example
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient.8">dhclient(8)</a>,

	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ospfd.8">ospfd(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ospf6d.8">ospf6d(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pflogd.8">pflogd(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/radiusd.8">radiusd(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.8">relayd(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ripd.8">ripd(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/script.1">script(1)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/syslogd.8">syslogd(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tcpdump.8">tcpdump(8)</a>,

	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/xconsole.1">xconsole(1)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/xdm.1">xdm(1)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/Xserver.1">Xserver(1)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ypldap.8">ypldap(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1">pkg_add(1)</a>,
	etc.
    <li><strong>Privilege revocation</strong>:
	Related to the work on privilege separation, some programs were refactored
	to drop privileges while holding onto a tricky resource such as a raw socket,
	reserved port, or modification-locked bpf(4) descriptor,
	for example
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ping.8">ping(8)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/traceroute.8">traceroute(8)</a>,
	etc.
    <li><strong>Stack protector</strong>:
	Developed since 2001 as "propolice" by Hiroaki Etoh. Integrated, and
	implemented for additional hardware platforms, by Federico G. Schwindt,
	Miod Vallat and Theo de Raadt.  OpenBSD 3.3 was the first operating
	system to enable it systemwide by default.
    <li><strong>W^X</strong>:
	First used for sparc, sparc64, alpha, and hppa in OpenBSD 3.3.
	Strictly enforced by default since OpenBSD 6.0: a program can only
	violate it if the executable is marked with <code>PT_OPENBSD_WXNEEDED</code>
	and it is located on a filesystem mounted with the <code>wxallowed</code>
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mount.8">mount(8)</a> option.
    <li><strong>GOT and PLT protection</strong> by ld.so:
	first done as part of the W^X work in OpenBSD 3.3, by Dale Rahn and
	Theo de Raadt. The GOT and PLT regions are read-only outside of ld.so
	itself. Extended to the .init/.fini sections (constructors and
	destructors) in OpenBSD 3.4.
    <li><strong>ASLR</strong>:
	OpenBSD 3.4 was the first widely used operating system to
	provide it by default.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/gcc-local.1">gcc-local(1)</a>
	__attribute__((__bounded__)) static analysis annotation
	and checking mechanism:
	Started by Anil Madhavapeddy on June 26, 2003
	and ported to GCC 4 by Nicholas Marriott.
	First released with OpenBSD 3.4.
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc.3">malloc(3)</a>
	randomization implemented by Thierry Deval. Guard pages and randomized (delayed) free added by Ted Unangst.
	Reimplemented by <a href="papers/eurobsdcon2009/otto-malloc.pdf">Otto Moerbeek</a>
	for OpenBSD 4.4.
    <li><strong>Position-independent executables (PIE)</strong>:
	OpenBSD 5.3 was the first widely used operating system to enable it
	globally by default, on seven hardware platforms.
	Implemented in November 2008 by
	<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/nycbsdcon08-pie/">Kurt Miller</a>
	and enabled by default by
	<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/papers/asiabsdcon2015-pie-slides.pdf">Pascal Stumpf</a>
	in August 2012.
    <li><strong>Random-data memory</strong>:
	the ability to specify that a variable should be initialized
	at load time with random byte values (placed into a new ELF
	<b>.openbsd.randomdata</b> section) was implemented in
	OpenBSD 5.3 by Matthew Dempsky.
    <li><strong>Stack protector per shared object</strong>:
	using the random-data memory feature, each shared object was given its
	own stack protector cookie in OpenBSD 5.3 by Matthew Dempsky.
    <li><strong>Static-PIE</strong>:
	Position-independent static binaries for /bin, /sbin and ramdisks.
	Implemented for OpenBSD 5.7 by Kurt Miller and Mark Kettenis.
    <li><strong>SROP</strong>
	(<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sigreturn.2">sigreturn(2)</a>
	oriented programming) mitigation: attacks researched by
	<a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/~herbertb/papers/srop_sp14.pdf">Eric Bosman</a>
	and Herbert Bos in 2014, solution implemented by Theo de Raadt in May 2016,
	enabled by default since OpenBSD 6.0.
    <li><strong>Library order randomization</strong>:
	In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc.8">rc(8)</a>, re-link
	<code>libc.so</code>, <code>libcrypto</code>, and <code>ld.so</code>
	on startup, placing the objects in a random order.
	Theo de Raadt and Robert Peichaer, May 2016,
	enabled by default since OpenBSD 6.0 and 6.2.
    <li>Kernel-assisted lazy-binding for W^X safety in multi-threaded programs.
	A new syscall <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kbind.2">kbind(2)</a>
	permits lazy-binding to be W^X safe in multi-threaded programs.
	Implemented for OpenBSD 5.9 by Philip Guenther in July 2015.
    <li>Process layouts in memory tightened to remove execute permission from
	all segmented, non-instruction data and to remove write permission from
	data that is only modified during loading and relocation.
	By combining the RELRO (Read-Only after Relocation) design from the
	GNU project with the original ASLR work from OpenBSD 3.3 and
	strict lazy-binding work from OpenBSD 5.9, this is applied to not
	just a subset of programs and libraries but rather to all programs
	and libraries.
	Implemented for OpenBSD 6.1 by Philip Guenther in August 2016.
    <li>Use of <strong>fork+exec in privilege separated programs</strong>. The
	strategy is to give each process a fresh &amp; unique address space for
	ASLR, stack protector -- as protection against address space discovery attacks.
	Implemented first by
	Damien Miller (<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a> 2004),
	Claudio Jeker (<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>, 2015),
	Eric Faurot (<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a>, 2016),
	Rafael Zalamena (various, 2016), and others.
    <li><strong>trapsleds</strong>:
	Reduction of incidental NOP instructions/sequences in the instruction
	stream which could be useful potentially for ROP attack methods to
	innaccurately target gadgets. These NOP sequences are converted into
	trap sequences where possible. Todd Mortimer and Theo de Raadt, June
	2017.
    <li><strong>Kernel relinking at boot</strong>:
	the .o files of the kernel are relinked in random order from a
	link-kit, before every reboot. This provides substantial interior
	randomization in the kernel's text and data segments for layout and
	relative branches/calls.  Basically a unique address space for each
	kernel boot, similar to the userland fork+exec model described above
	but for the kernel.  Theo de Raadt, June 2017.
    <li>Rearranged i386/amd64 register allocator order in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/clang.1">clang(1)</a>
	to reduce polymorphic RET instructions:
	Todd Mortimer, November 20, 2017.
    <li>Reencoding of i386/amd64 instruction sequences to avoid
	embedded polymorphic RET instructions.  Enhancements to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/clang.1">clang(1)</a>
	Todd Mortimer, April 28, 2018 and onwards.
    <li><b>MAP_STACK</b> addition to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mmap.2">mmap(2)</a>
	allows opportunistic verification that the stack-register
	points at stack memory, therefore catching pivots to non-stack
	memory (sometimes used in ROP attacks).
	Theo de Raadt, April 12, 2018.
    <li><b>RETGUARD</b> is a replacement for the <b>stack-protector</b>
	which uses a per-function random cookie (located in the read-only ELF
	<b>.openbsd.randomdata</b> section) to consistency-check the
	return address on the stack.  Implemented for amd64 and arm64
	by Todd Mortimer in OpenBSD 6.4, for mips64 in OpenBSD 6.7, and
	powerpc/powerpc64 in OpenBSD 6.9.  amd64 system call stubs also
	protected in OpenBSD 7.3.
    <li><b>MAP_CONCEAL</b> addition to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mmap.2">mmap(2)</a>
	disallows memory pages to be written to core dumps, preventing
	accidental exposure of private information.
	Theo de Raadt, Mark Kettenis and Scott Soule Cheloha,
	February 2, 2019.
    <li>Similar to the opportunistic verification in <b>MAP_STACK</b>,
	system-calls can no longer be performed from PROT_WRITE memory.
	Theo de Raadt, June 2, 2019.
    <li>System calls may only be performed from selected code regions
        (main program, ld.so, libc.so, and sigtramp).  The libc.so region
	is setup by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/msyscall.2">msyscall(2)</a>.
	Theo de Raadt, November 28, 2019.<br>
	This mechanism was removed because later work on immutable memory +
	pinned system calls was even better.
    <li>Permissions (RWX, MAP_STACK, etc) on address space regions can be
	made immutable, so that <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mmap.2">mmap(2)</a>,
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mprotect.2">mprotect(2)</a> or
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/munmap.2">munmap(2)</a> fail with
	EPERM. Most of the program static address space is now automatically
	immutable (main program, ld.so, main stack, load-time shared libraries,
	and dlopen()'d libraries mapped without RTLD_NODELETE).  Programmers
	can request non-immutable static data using the "openbsd.mutable" section,
	or manually bring immutability to (page aligned heap objects) using
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mimmutable.2">mimmutable(2)</a>.
	Theo de Raadt, Dec 4, 2022.
    <li>sshd random relinking at boot. Theo de Raadt. Jan 18, 2023.
    <li>Some architectures now have non-readable code ("xonly"), both from
	the perspective of userland reading its own memory, or the kernel
	trying to read memory in a system call.  Many sloppy practices in
	userland code had to be repaired to allow this.  The linker option
	<b>--execute-only</b> is enabled by default. In order of
	development: arm64, riscv64, hppa, amd64,
	powerpc64, powerpc (G5 only), octeon.
	sparc64 (sun4u only, unfinished).
	Mark Kettenis, Theo de Raadt, Visa Hankala, Miod Vallat,
	Dave Voutila, George Koehler in kernel and base, and
	Theo Buehler, Robert Nagy, Christian Weisgerber in ports.
	Dec 2022 - Feb 2023, still ongoing.
    <li>On all architectures which lack hardware-enforcement of xonly,
	system calls are now prevented from reading (via copyin/copyinst)
	inside the program's main text, ld.so text, sigtramp text, or
	libc.so text.
	Theo de Raadt, Jan 2023.
    <li>Architectures which lack xonly mmu-enforcement can still benefit
	from switching to --execute-only binaries if the cpu generates
	different traps for instruction-fetch versus data-fetch.  The
	VM system will not allow memory to be read before it was
	executed which is valuable together with library relinking.
	Architectures switched over include loongson.
	Theo de Raadt, Feb 2023.
    <li>ld.so and crt0 register the location of the
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/execve.2">execve(2)</a>
	libc syscall stub with the kernel using
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscall.2">pinsyscall(2)</a>,
	after which the kernel only accepts an execve call from that
	specific location. Theo de Raadt, Feb 2023. Made redundant by
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscalls.2">pinsyscalls(2)</a>
        which handles all system calls.
    <li>Mandatory enforcement of indirect branch targets (BTI on arm64,
        IBT on Intel amd64), unless a linker flag (-Wl,-z,nobtcfi) requests
        no enforcement.
    <li>The kernel and ld.so register the precise entry location of
	every system call used by a program, as described in the
	new ELF section <b>.openbsd.syscalls</b> inside ld.so and
	libc.so.  ld.so uses the new syscall
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pinsyscalls.2">pinsyscalls(2)</a>
        to tell the kernel the precise entry location of system calls in libc.so.
	Since all syscall entries are now known to the kernel, the
	pininsyscall(SYS_execve) interface becomes redundant.
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/msyscall.2">msyscall(2)</a> mechanism
	also becomes redundant (and is removed a bit later), because immutable
	memory + pinsyscalls together are cheaper and more effective targetting.
	Theo de Raadt, Jan 2024.
