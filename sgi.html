<p>
OpenBSD/sgi runs on most 64 bit MIPS-based SGI servers and workstations.
OpenBSD/sgi is a fully featured 64 bit port and will thus only run on systems
based on 64 bit processors, i.e. R4000 and up.

<p>
<strong>The OpenBSD/sgi port was discontinued after the 6.5 release.</strong>

<p>
A mailing list dedicated to the OpenBSD/sgi port is available at
<a href="mailto:sgi@openbsd.org">sgi@openbsd.org</a>.
To join the OpenBSD/sgi mailing list, send a message body of <b>"subscribe

<h3 id="history"><strong>History</strong></h3>

<p>
The OpenBSD/sgi port has its roots in the <a href="arc.html">OpenBSD/arc</a>
port created early in the OpenBSD history. ARC support was rather soon
discontinued due to the lack of interest and availability of decent hardware.

<p>
Eventually SGI hardware became more affordable and obtainable, and interest
for an SGI port in the tree increased.
The final piece, a working 64 bit toolchain, eventually became available and
allowed the 64 bit SGI OpenBSD port to appear in 2004.

<p>
Hardware support was initially limited to the O2 workstations.  Efforts
to port to more systems did not really start until 2008, where the first
Octane support parts were introduced. This work was completed in 2009
with support for Origin family systems as well, allowing OpenBSD to be
the first free operating system to run on the Fuel workstations, and even
later, also on Origin 350 servers.

<p>
The earlier generation of R4000 Indigo, Indy and Indigo2 was not forgotten
either and support for it appeared in 2012. This paved the way for
R8000 and R10000 <i>POWER Indigo2</i> support as well.

<h3 id="status"><strong>Current status</strong></h3>

<p>
OpenBSD/sgi runs in 64 bit mode and boots multi-user on supported
systems. Snapshots are made periodically as the port develops and expands.
<br>
All graphics options but the IP27 Kona frame buffer should be supported;
on such setups the kernel will be limited to serial console operation only.
<br>
An X server, currently unaccelerated, is also available for IP32 (O2) systems.

For a complete system component and device driver listing for this architecture, see <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sgi/intro.4">intro(4/sgi)</a>.

<p>
The following families are supported:
<ul>
<li>IP20 (R4000 Indigo) family:
  <ul>

  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>

  <ul>
  <li>POWER Indigo2 R8000
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>IP27 (Origin) family:
  <ul>
  <li>Origin 200
  </ul>
  Origin 2000 and Onyx 2 are not supported yet. Single-node multiprocessor
  operation is supported on Origin 200.
</ul>
<ul>
<li>IP28 (<i>POWER Indigo2</i>) family:
  <ul>
  <li>POWER Indigo2 R10000
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>IP30 (Octane a.k.a <i>Speedracer</i>) family:
  <ul>
  <li>Octane
  <li>Octane 2
  </ul>
  Multiprocessor operation is supported.
</ul>
<ul>
<li>IP32 (O2 a.k.a <i>Moosehead</i>) family:
  <ul>
  <li>O2
  <li>O2+
  </ul>
R5000, RM5200, RM7000 as well as R10000 and R12000 processor options are
supported, including the RM7000 level 3 cache.
</ul>
<ul>
<li>IP35 (Tezro) family:
  <ul>
  <li>Fuel
  <li>Origin 3000
  <li>Origin 350
  <li>Tezro
  <li>Onyx 4 (currently limited to serial console)
  <li>Onyx 350 has not been tested, but ought to work
      since it is very similar to Origin 350.
  </ul>
  Origin 300 and Onyx 300 are not supported yet. Single-node multiprocessor
  operation is supported at least on Origin 350.
</ul>
Note that <i>Octane 3</i> and <i>Origin 400</i> systems are completely different
architectures based on x86 processors, and as such are not supported
by OpenBSD/sgi.
