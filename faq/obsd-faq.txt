     _________________________________________________________________

1.1 - What is OpenBSD?

   The [7]OpenBSD project produces a freely available, multi-platform
   4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. Our efforts place emphasis on
   portability, standardization, correctness, and security. [8]OpenBSD
   supports binary emulation of most binaries from SVR4 (Solaris),
   FreeBSD, Linux, BSDI, SunOS, and HPUX.

1.2 - On what systems does OpenBSD run?

   OpenBSD 2.6 runs on the following platforms:
     * [9]i386 - CD bootable
     * [10]sparc - CD bootable
     * [11]alpha - CD bootable
     * [12]hp300
     * [13]amiga
     * [14]mac68k
     * [15]powerpc
     * [16]pmax
     * [17]mvme68k
     * [18]mvme88k

   The ports for pmax, mvme68k, and mvme88k are not included on the 2.6
   CDs. They can be downloaded from any of the OpenBSD ftp sites

   bootable means that OpenBSD will boot directly from the CD. The CD set
   will boot on several hardware platforms. See [19]section 3.0 of this
   FAQ for details of obtaining OpenBSD on CD.

   Previous releases of OpenBSD also had a port for:
     * [20]arc

   This port was removed from the 2.4 release, but was included in 2.3 if
   you are interested. If you have the proper equipment, bring them up to
   date! You can see updated information about specific platforms at
   [21]http://www.openbsd.org/plat.html

   Yes, OpenBSD will run on your multiprocessor machine, but it will only
   use one processor. There currently is no support for SMP. Check
   [22]8.12

1.3 - Is OpenBSD really free?

   OpenBSD is all free. The binaries are free. The source is free. All
   parts of OpenBSD have reasonable copyright terms permitting free
   redistribution. This includes the ability to REUSE most parts of the
   OpenBSD source tree, either for personal or commercial purposes.
   OpenBSD includes NO further restrictions other than those implied by
   the original BSD license. Software which is written under stricter
   licenses cannot be included in the regular distribution of OpenBSD.
   This is intended to safeguard the free use of OpenBSD. For example,
   OpenBSD can be freely used for personal use, for academic use, by
   government institutions, by non-profit making organizations and by
   commercial organizations.

   For further reading on other popular licenses read:
   [23]http://www.openbsd.org/policy.html.

   The maintainers of OpenBSD support the project largely from their own
   pockets. This includes the time spent programming for the project,
   equipment used to support the many ports, the network resources used
   to distribute OpenBSD to you, and the time spent answering questions
   and investigating users' bug reports. The OpenBSD developers are not
   independently wealthy and even small contributions of time, equipment,
   and resources make a big difference.

1.4 - Why might I want to use OpenBSD?

   New users frequently want to know whether OpenBSD is superior to some
   other free UNIX-like operating system. That question is largely
   un-answerable and is the subject of countless (and useless) religious
   debates. Do not, under any circumstances, ask such a question on an
   OpenBSD mailing list.

   Below are some reasons why we think OpenBSD is a useful operating
   system. Whether OpenBSD is right for you is a question that only you
   can answer.

     * OpenBSD runs on many different hardware platforms.
     * OpenBSD is thought of by many security professionals to be the
       most secure UNIX-like operating system as the result of a
       10-member 1.5-year long comprehensive source code security audit.
     * OpenBSD is a full-featured UNIX-like operating system available in
       source form at no charge.
     * OpenBSD integrates cutting-edge security technology suitable for
       building firewalls and private network services in a distributed
       environment.
     * OpenBSD benefits from strong on-going development in many areas,
       offering opportunities to work with emerging technologies with an
       international community of programmers and end-users.
     * OpenBSD offers opportunities for ordinary people to participate in
       the development and testing of the product.

1.5 - How can I help support OpenBSD?

   We are greatly indebted to the people and organizations that have
   contributed to the OpenBSD project. They are acknowledged by name
   here:

   [24]http://www.openbsd.org/donations.html

   OpenBSD has a constant need for several types of support from the user
   community. If you find OpenBSD useful, you are strongly encouraged to
   find a way to contribute. If none of the suggestions below are right
   for you, feel free to propose an alternative by sending e-mail to
   [25]donations@openbsd.org.

     * Buy an OpenBSD CD. It includes the current full release of
       OpenBSD, and is bootable on many platforms. It also generates
       revenue to support the OpenBSD project, and reduces the strain on
       network resources used to deliver the distribution via the
       Internet. This inexpensive two-CD set includes full source.
       Remember, your friends need their own copy!
     * Donate money. The project has a constant need for cash to pay for
       equipment, network connectivity, and expenses relating to CD
       publishing. Manufacturing CDs requires an up-front out-of-pocket
       investment for the OpenBSD developers, without guaranteed return.
       Send e-mail to [26]donations@openbsd.org to find out how to
       contribute. Even small donations make a profound difference.
     * Donate equipment and parts. The project has a constant need for
       general and specific hardware. Items such as IDE and SCSI disks,
       and various types of RAM are always welcome. For other types of
       hardware such as computer systems and motherboards, you should
       inquire as to current need. Write to [27]donations@openbsd.org to
       arrange for shipment.
     * Donate your time and skills. Programmers who enjoy writing
       operating systems are naturally always welcome, but there are
       literally dozens of other ways that people can be useful. Follow
       mailing lists and help answer new-user questions.
     * Help maintain documentation by submitting new FAQ material (to
       [28]faq@openbsd.org). Form a local user group and get your friends
       hooked on OpenBSD. Make a case to your employer for using OpenBSD
       at work. If you're a student, talk to your professors about using
       OpenBSD as a learning tool for Computer Science or Engineering
       courses. It's also worth mentioning one of the most important ways
       you should not try to "help" The OpenBSD project: do not waste
       your time engaging in operating system flame wars on Usenet
       newsgroups. It does not help the project to find new users and can
       cause substantial harm to important relationships that developers
       have with other developers.

1.6 - Who maintains OpenBSD?

   OpenBSD is maintained by a development team spread across many
   different countries. The project is coordinated by Theo de Raadt,
   located in Canada.

2.1 - Web Pages of Interest

   The official website for the OpenBSD project is located at:
   [5]http://www.OpenBSD.org

   A lot of valuable information can be found here regarding all aspects
   of the OpenBSD project.

   Additional information for laptop users can be found at:
   [6]http://www.monkey.org/openbsd-mobile/

2.2 - Mailing Lists

   The OpenBSD project maintains several popular mailing lists which
   users should subscribe to and follow. To subscribe to a mailing list,
   send an e-mail message to [7]majordomo@openbsd.org. That address is an
   automated subscription service. In the body of your message, on a
   single line, you should include a subscribe command for the list you
   wish to join. For example:
subscribe announce

   The list processor will reply to you, asking for confirmation of your
   intent to join the list. The confirmation you send back to the list
   processor will be included in its reply to you. It will look something
   like this:
auth 90855167 subscribe announce you@example.com

   Once you have confirmed your intent to join, you will be immediately
   added to the list, and the list processor will notify you that you
   were successfully added.

   To unsubscribe from a list, you will again send an e-mail message to
   [8]majordomo@openbsd.org. It might look like this:
unsubscribe announce

   If you have any difficulties with the mailing list system, please
   first read the instructions. They can be obtained by sending an e-mail
   message to [9]majordomo@openbsd.org with a message body of "help".
   These are the currently-available OpenBSD mailing lists:

     * announce - Important announcements. This is a low-volume list.
     * tech - General technical discussions
     * misc - User questions and answers
     * bugs - Bugs received via sendbug(1) and discussions about them.
     * source-changes - Automated mailing of CVS source tree changes.
     * ports - Discussion of the OpenBSD Ports Tree
     * advocacy - Discussion of advocating OpenBSD.

   Archives of the OpenBSD mailing lists can be found by visiting the
   mailing lists web page: [10]http://www.openbsd.org/mail.html
   You can also get mail archives from
   [11]http://www.monkey.org/cgi-bin/wilma or

   'echo subscribe | mail "openbsd-mobile-request@monkey.org"'

   The archives for that can be found at:
   [14]http://www.monkey.org/openbsd-mobile/archive/

2.3 - Manual Pages

   OpenBSD comes with extensive documentation in the form of manual
   pages, as well as longer documents relating to specific applications.
   To access the manual pages and other documentation, be sure that you
   installed the man, misc, and text distributions.

   Here is a list of some of the most useful manual pages for new users:

     * [15]afterboot(8) - things to check after the first complete boot
     * [16]boot(8) - system boot strapping procedures
     * [17]passwd.conf(5) - format of the password configuration file
     * [18]adduser_proc(8) - procedure for adding new users
     * [19]adduser(8) - command for adding new users
     * [20]vipw(8) - edit the pass word file
     * [21]man(1) - display the on-line manual pages
     * [22]sendbug(1) - send a problem report (PR) about OpenBSD to a
       central support site.
     * [23]disklabel(8) - Read and write disk pack label.
     * [24]ifconfig(8) - configure network interface parameters.
     * [25]route(8) - manually manipulate the routing tables.
     * [26]netstat(1) - show network status.
     * [27]reboot, halt(8) - Stopping and restarting the system.
     * [28]shutdown(8) - close down the system at a given time.
     * [29]boot_config(8) - how to change kernel configuration at boot

   Also, If you are one of the people who didn't install the man*.tar.gz
   package, you can find all the OpenBSD man pages on the web at
   [30]http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi.

   In general, if you know the name of a command or a manual page, you
   can read it by executing `man command'. For example: `man vi' to read
   about the vi editor. If you don't know the name of the command, or if
   `man command' doesn't find the manual page, you can search the manual
   page database by executing `apropos something' or `man -k something'
   where something is a likely word that might appear in the title of the
   manual page you're looking for. For example:
bsd# apropos "time zone"
tzfile (5) - time zone information
zdump (8) - time zone dumper
zic (8) - time zone compiler

   The parenthetical numbers indicate the section of the manual in which
   that page can be found. In some cases, you may find manual pages with
   identical names living in separate sections of the manual. For
   example, assume that you want to know the format of the configuration
   files for the cron daemon. Once you know the section of the manual for
   the page you want, you would execute `man n command' where n is the
   manual section number.
bsd# man -k cron
cron (8) - daemon to execute scheduled commands (Vixie Cron)
crontab (1) - maintain crontab files for individual users (V3)
crontab (5) - tables for driving cron
bsd# man 5 crontab

   In addition to the UNIX manual pages, there is a typesettable document
   set (included in the misc distribution). It lives in the
   /usr/share/doc directory. If you also installed the text distribution,
   then you can format each document set with a `make' in the appropriate
   subdirectory. The psd subdirectory is the Programmer's Supplementary
   Documents distribution. The smm subdirectory is the System Manager's
   Manual. The usd subdirectory is the UNIX User's Supplementary
   Documents distribution. You can perform your `make' in the three
   distribution subdirectories, or you can select a specific section of a
   distribution and do a `make' in its subdirectory. Some of the
   subdirectories are empty. By default, formatting the documents will
   result in Postscript output, suitable for printing. The Postscript
   output can be quite large -- you should assume 250-300% increase in
   volume. If you do not have access to a Postscript printer or display,
   you may also format the documents for reading on a terminal display.
   In each Makefile you'll need to add the flag -Tascii to each instance
   of the groff commands (or execute it by hand). Some of the documents
   use the ms formatting macros, and some use the me macros. The Makefile
   in each document subdirectory (eg, /usr/share/doc/usd/04.csh/Makefile)
   will tell you which one to use. For example:
bsd# cd /usr/share/doc/usd/04.csh
bsd# groff -Tascii -ms tabs csh.1 csh.2 csh.3 csh.4 csh.a csh.g > csh.txt
bsd# more csh.txt

   The UNIX manual pages are generally more current and trustworthy than
   the typesettable documents. The typesettable documents sometimes
   explain complicated applications in more detail than the manual pages
   do.

   For many, having a hardcopy of the man page can be useful. Here are
   the guidelines to making a printable copy of a man page.

  How do I display a man page source file? (i.e., one whose filename ends in a
  number, like tcpdump.8).

   This is found throughout the src tree. The man pages are found in the
   tree unformatted, and many times thru the use of [31]CVS, they will be
   updated. To view these pages simply :
# nroff -mdoc <file> | more

  How do I get a plain man page with no formatting or control characters?

   This is helpful to get the man page straight, with no non-printable
   characters.
   Example:
# man <command> | col -b

  How can I get a PostScript copy of a man page that's print-ready?

   Note that must be the man page source file (probably a file that ends
   in a number; i.e., tcpdump.8). The PostScript versions of the man
   pages look very nice. They can be printed or viewed on-screen with a
   program like gv (GhostView). GhostView can be found in our [32]Ports
   Tree.
# groff -mdoc -Tps <man_src_file> > outfile.ps

2.4 - Reporting Bugs

   Before submitting any bug report, please read
   [33]http://www.openbsd.org/report.html

   Proper bug reporting is one of the most important responsibilities of
   end users. Very detailed information is required to diagnose most
   serious bugs. Developers frequently get bugs reports via e-mail such
   as these:
From: joeuser@example.com
To: bugs@openbsd.org
Subject: HELP!!!

I have a PC and it won't boot!!!!! It's a 486!!!!!


   Hopefully most people understand why such reports get summarily
   deleted. All bug reports should contain detailed information. If Joe
   User had really wanted his bug investigated, his bug report would have
   looked something like this:
From: smartuser@example.com
To: bugs@openbsd.org
Subject: 2.6 panics on an i386

After installing OpenBSD 2.6 from the CD which I purchased via your outstanding
on-line ordering system, I find that the system halts before the kernel even
gets loaded. After booting with a bootdisk and escaping to a shell. This is the
dmesg output:

Thank you!

   If Joe User had a working OpenBSD system from which he wanted to
   submit a bug report, he would have used the sendbug(1) utility to
   submit his bug report to the GNATS problem tracking system. Obviously
   you can't use sendbug(1) when your system won't boot, but you should
   use it whenever possible. You will still need to include detailed
   information about what happened, the exact configuration of your
   system, and how to reproduce the problem. The sendbug(1) command
   requires that your system be able to deliver electronic mail
   successfully on the Internet.

   If you have submitted a bug report and you want to check its current
   status without annoying anyone, the best ways are:

     * Visit the GNATS tracking system:
       [34]http://cvs.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/wwwgnats.pl.
     * Look in the [35]bugs@openbsd.org list archives:
       [36]http://www.openbsd.org/mail.html.

     _________________________________________________________________

3.1 - Buying an OpenBSD CD

   Purchasing an OpenBSD CD is generally the best way to get started.
   Visit the ordering page to purchase your copy:
   [6]http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html.

   There are many good reasons to own an OpenBSD CD:
     * CD sales support on-going development of OpenBSD.
     * Development of a multi-platform operating system requires constant
       investment in equipment.
     * Your support in the form of a CD purchase has a real impact on
       future development.
     * The CD contains binaries (and source) for all supported platforms.
     * The CD is bootable on several platforms, and can be used to
       bootstrap a machine without a pre-existing installed operating
       system.
     * The CD is useful for bootstrapping even if you choose to install a
       snapshot.
     * Installing from CD is faster! Installing from CD preserves network
       connectivity resources.
     * OpenBSD CD's always come with very nice stickers. You system isn't
       fully complete without these. You can only get these stickers by
       buying a CD set or donating hardware.

   If you're installing a release version of OpenBSD, you should use a
   CD. Snapshot releases can only be installed over the network.

3.1.1 - Buying OpenBSD T-Shirts

   Yes, OpenBSD now has t-shirts for your wearing enjoyment. You can view
   these at [7]http://www.OpenBSD.org/tshirts.html. Enjoy :)

3.1.2 - Does OpenBSD provide an ISO image available for download?

   You can't. The official OpenBSD CD-ROM layout is copyright Theo de
   Raadt, as an incentive for people to buy the CD set. Note that only
   the layout is copyrighted, OpenBSD itself is free. Nothing precludes
   someone else to just grab OpenBSD and make their own CD.

3.2 - Downloading via FTP or AFS

   There are numerous international mirror sites offering FTP access to
   OpenBSD releases and snapshots. AFS access is also available. You
   should always use the site closest to you. Before you begin fetching a
   release or snapshot, you may wish to use ping and traceroute to
   determine which mirror site is nearest to you and whether that nearest
   mirror is performing adequately. Of course, your OpenBSD release CD is
   always closer than any mirror. Access information is here:

   [8]http://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html

3.3 - Obtaining Current Source Code

   Source to OpenBSD is freely redistributable and available at no
   charge. Generally the best way to get started with a current source
   tree is to install the source from the most recent CD and then
   configure AnonCVS to update it regularly. Information about AnonCVS,
   including how to set it up, is available here:

   [9]http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html.

   or check [10]The OpenBSD FAQ

   If you don't have sufficient network bandwidth to support AnonCVS, or
   if your Internet access is via UUCP, you can still keep your source
   current by using CTM instead of AnonCVS. If that's your situation,
   then starting with a recent release CD is even more important.
   Information about CTM, including how to set it up, is available here:

   [11]http://www.openbsd.org/ctm.html.

   Yet another alternative is to get the source code from the web. You
   can do that thru cvsweb at:
   [12]Http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/

     _________________________________________________________________

4.1 - Overview of the OpenBSD installation procedure

   OpenBSD provides multiple ways of installing a fresh OpenBSD system
   for multiple architectures. This will give most everyone in almost any
   situation to be able to install an OpenBSD system. The seperate ways
   of installing an OpenBSD system are as follows:
     * CD-ROM - For this you will need to have purchased and OpenBSD CD.
       You can do so by going to [7]http://www.openbsd.org/orders.html.
       This is probably the easiest way of installing OpenBSD.
     * FTP - This option requires you know your IP, Netmask, Gateway,
       etc. If this is so, there is an enormous list of ftp mirrors
       around the world which make this a speedy way of getting OpenBSD
       on your system.
     * DHCP - This options is the same as FTP except that your IP,
       Netmask, Gateway and Nameservers are retrieved from the DHCP
       server.
     * Local Filesystem - This option allows you to install from files on
       a pre-existing filesystem. Support for DOS, EXT2FS and FFS are
       included on the install disk.
     * NFS - This allows you to install from files located on an nfs
       server. Read [8]mount_nfs(8) for more information.

   All these methods of installation are available on ONE floppy disk.
   These disks can be downloaded directly from any of the ftp mirrors. (
   You can get a list of mirrors on [9]http://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html. )
   Each architecture has their own disk, so make sure you get the correct
   disk for your architecture. A list of supported architectures can be
   found in [10]FAQ 1.

   Here are detailed, complete walk-through guides of the installation
   process for i386 and sparc architectures. Don't forget to look at the
   [11]INSTALL.i386 and [12]INSTALL.sparc documents also.
     * [13]install-i386.html for i386 architecture.
     * [14]install-sparc.html for sparc architecture.

   People using other architectures are urged to look at the INSTALL.arch
   document that comes with the OpenBSD distribution for their
   architecture, as well as this [15]generic installation walkthrough.

  Alpha architecture notes

   Your alpha must use SRM firmware, as opposed to ARC. With the alpha
   architechture you can install by booting from the CD using CD2. You
   can do this by using a command such as
   boot -fi 2.6/alpha/bsd.rd dkaX

   Use show device to find your CDROM drive identifier. If you are unable
   to boot from the CD, you can still use the bootdisk provided at
   CD2:2.6/alpha/floppy26.fs, and write it using the ways detailed above
   for the i386 architecture. And again follow the [16]install
   walkthrough guide.

4.2 - What files are needed for Installation?

   There are many packages containing the OpenBSD binaries, but which
   ones do you need to get your system up and running? Here is an
   overview of each package.

     * base26.tar.gz - Has the base OpenBSD system Required
     * etc26.tar.gz - Has all the files in /etc Required
     * comp26.tar.gz - Has the compiler and its tools, libs. Recommended
     * man26.tar.gz - Holds man pages Recommended
     * misc26.tar.gz - Holds misc info, setup docs
     * game26.tar.gz - Has the games for OpenBSD
     * xbase26.tar.gz - Has the base install for X11
     * xfont26.tar.gz - Holds X11's font server and fonts
     * xlink26.tar.gz - Has the X servers link kit
     * xserv26.tar.gz - Has X11's X servers
     * xshare26.tar.gz - Has manpages, locale settings, includes, etc for
       X
     * bsd - This is the Kernel. Required

4.3 - How much space do I need for an OpenBSD installation?

   The following are suggested sub-tree sizes for a full system install.
   The numbers include enough extra space to permit you to run a typical
   home system that is connected to the internet.
     * For a multiuser system, you probably want to triple these values.
     * If you plan to install a significant amount of third party
       software, make your /usr parition large! At least triple these
       values!
     * For a system that handles lots of email or web pages (stored,
       respectively, in /var/mail and /var/www) you will want to make
       your /var partition significantly larger.
     * For a multiuser system which may generate lots of logs, you will
       still want to make your /var partition significantly larger
       (/var/log).

   As you read this, keep in mind that /usr and /usr/X11R6 are usually
   both parts of the same filesystem, that is, /usr, as there is no big
   advantage to making them into separate filesystems.
SYSTEM          /       /usr    /var    /usr/X11R6
alpha           56M     540M    27M     161M
amiga           45M     399M    24M      36M
hp300           31M     234M    24M      47M
i386            35M     229M    24M      72M
mac68k          29M     232M    24M      36M
mvme68k         29M     232M    24M       -  (no Xserver)
pmax            50M     355M    24M      60M
sparc           40M     259M    24M      49M

   When you are in the disklabel editor, you may choose to make your
   entire system have just an 'a' (main filesystem) and 'b' (swap) . The
   'a' filesystem which you set up in disklabel will become your root
   partition, which should be the sum of all the 3 main values above (/,
   /usr, and /var) plus some space for /tmp. The 'b' partition you set up
   automatically becomes your system swap partition -- we recommend a
   minimum of 32MB but if you have disk to spare make it at least 64MB.
   If you have lots of disk space to spare, make this 256MB, or even
   512MB.

   There are four main reasons for using separate filesystems, instead of
   shoving everything into one or two filesystems:
     * Security: You can mark some filesystems as 'nosuid', 'nodev',
       'noexec', 'readonly', etc..
     * Stability: A user, or a misbehaved program, can fill a filesystem
       with garbage, if they have write permissions for it. Your critical
       programs, which of course run on a different filesystem, do not
       get interrupted.
     * Speed: A filesystem which gets written to frequently may get
       somewhat fragmented. (Luckily, the ffs filesystem, what OpenBSD
       uses, is not prone to heavy fragmentation.)
     * Integrity: If one filesystem is corrupted for some reason then
       your other filesystems are still OK.

4.4 - Multibooting OpenBSD (i386, alpha)

   OpenBSD & NT

   To multiboot OpenBSD and NT, you can use NTloader, the bootloader that
   NT uses. To multi-boot with NT, you need a copy of your OpenBSD pbr.
   After running installboot, you can copy it something like this:
        # dd if=/dev/rsd0c of=openbsd.pbr bs=512 count=1

   Now boot NT and put openbsd.pbr in c:. Add a line like this to the end
   of c:\boot.ini:
        c:\openbsd.pbr="OpenBSD"

   When you reboot, you should be able to select OpenBSD from the NT
   loader menu. There is much more information available about NTloader
   at the [17]NTLDR Hacking Guide.

   OpenBSD & Windows or DOS (i386)

   To boot OpenBSD along with Windows 3.1, Windows95, or DOS you must use
   a boot loader on the system that can handle OpenBSD, Windows, and DOS!
   Some bootloaders of choice are [18]osbs20b8.zip or [19]The Ranish
   Partition Manager. Both of these are able to boot OpenBSD partitions.

   OpenBSD & Linux (i386)

   Please refer to [20]INSTALL.linux, which gives indepth instructions on
   getting OpenBSD working with Linux.

4.5 - Sending your dmesg to dmesg@openbsd.org after the install

   Just to remind people, it's important for the OpenBSD developers to
   keep track of what hardware works, and what hardware doesn't work
   perfectly..

   A quote from /usr/src/etc/root/root.mail
If you wish to ensure that OpenBSD runs better on your machines, please do us
a favor (after you have your mail system setup!) and type
        dmesg | mail dmesg@openbsd.org
so that we can see what kinds of configurations people are running.  We will
use this information to improve device driver support in future releases.
(We would be much happier if this information was for the supplied GENERIC
kernel; not for a custom compiled kernel).  The device driver information
we get from this helps us fix existing drivers.

   Also check with [21]section 14.7

   Make sure you send email from an account that is able to also receive
   email so developers can contact you back if they have something they
   want you to test or change in order to get your setup working. It's
   not important at all to send the email from the same machine that is
   running OpenBSD, so if that machine is unable to receive email, just
 dmesg | mail your-account@yourmail.dom

   and then forward that message to
 dmesg@openbsd.org

   where your-account@yourmail.dom is your regular email account. (or
   transfer the dmesg output using ftp/scp/floppydisk/carrier-pigeon/...)

   NOTE - Please send only GENERIC kernel dmesg's. Custom kernels that
   have device drivers removed are not helpful.

     _________________________________________________________________

5.1 - Why would I want to create my own custom kernel?

   Several reasons, although this practice is generally geared towards
   knowledgeable users who have a good overall understanding of the
   system.
     * Your computer has a very small amount of RAM and you want to
       preserve as much as possible by removing device drivers you don't
       use
     * Remove default options or add options which may not have been
       enabled by default
     * Enable experimental options (such as TCP_SACK, TCP_FACK,
       FFS_SOFTUPDATES)

   Under most circumstances you will NOT need to compile your own kernel.
   The GENERIC kernel will usually be all that you need. In fact, there
   are several reasons why you do not want to create your own kernel. The
   main reason is that it is very easy to make changes to the kernel
   configuration which look logical, but do not work. This is your danger
   sign. If something does not appear to work properly, please try the
   GENERIC kernel before sending in a bug report.

5.2 - Kernel Configuration Options

   Kernel Configuration Options are options that you add to your kernel
   configuration that place certain features into your kernel. This
   allows you to have exactly the support you want, without having
   support for unneeded devices. There are multitudes of options that
   allow you to customize your kernel. Here we will go over only some of
   them, those that are most commonly used. Check the [7]options(4) man
   page for a more complete list of options. You can also check the
   example configuration files that are available for your architecture.

   Not all kernel options have been tested for compatibility with all
   other options. Don't put an option in your kernel unless you actually
   have a reason to do so! The one kernel configuration which gets the
   most testing is the GENERIC kernel. This is usually a combination of
   the options in /usr/src/sys/arch/<your arch>/conf/GENERIC and
   /usr/src/sys/conf/GENERIC.

     * [8]Alpha Kernel Conf Files
     * [9]i386 Kernel Configuration files
     * [10]mac68k Kernel Configuration files
     * [11]pmax Kernel Configuration Files
     * [12]sparc Kernel Configuration Files
     * [13]Other Arch's

   Look closely at these files and you will notice a line like:
   include "../../../conf/GENERIC"
   This means that it is referencing yet another configuration file. This
   file stores non arch-dependent options. So when creating your Kernel
   Config be sure to look through [14]/sys/conf/GENERIC and see what you
   want. There ARE options in there that are NEEDED.

   All of the options listed below should be placed in your kernel
   configuration file in the format of:
   option OPTION
   for example. To place option debug in the kernel, add a line like
   this:
   option DEBUG
   Options in the OpenBSD kernel are translated into compiler
   preprocessor options, therefore an option like DEBUG would have the
   source compiled with option -DDEBUG. Which is equivalent to doing a
   #define DEBUG throughout the kernel.

   OpenBSD has a great many compatibility options which allow you to use
   binaries from other OS's. Not all are availibly on every
   architechture, so be sure to read the man pages for each option to see
   if your arch is supported.

     * [15]COMPAT_SVR4(8) - Compatibility with SVR4 binaries.
     * [16]COMPAT_BSDOS(8) - Compatibility with BSD/OS binaries.
     * [17]COMPAT_LINUX(8) - Compatibility with Linux binaries.
     * [18]COMPAT_SUNOS(8) - Compatibility with SunOS binaries.
     * [19]COMPAT_ULTRIX(8) - Compatibility with Ultrix binaries.
     * [20]COMPAT_FREEBSD(8) - Compatibility with FreeBSD binaries.
     * COMPAT_HPUX - Compatibility with HP-UX binaries. Only available on
       some m68k arch's.
     * [21]COMPAT_IBCS2(8) - Compatibility to run ibcs2 binaries.
     * COMPAT_OSF1 - Run Digital Unix binaries. Available only on Alpha
       platform.
     * COMPAT_43 - Compatibility with 4.3BSD. Use of this is certainly
       discouraged, But it is needed for our Navigator port
     * COMPAT_11 - Compatibility with NetBSD 1.1
     * COMPAT_NOMID - Compatibility with a.out executables that lack a
       machine id.

   It is always helpful to be able to debug problems with the kernel. But
   many choose not to put these options in their kernel because these
   options add considerable size to the kernel. They are however
   extremely helpful in a case where a bug might be present. This well
   help the developers discover the source of your problems much quicker.
   Here is a list of popular debugging options that can be added to your
   kernel.

     * [22]DDB - This compiles in the in-kernel debugger. This isn't
       available on all platforms. So be sure to read before adding it.
     * [23]KGDB - Compiles a remote kernel debugger using gdb's `remote
       target` feature.
     * makeoptions DEBUG="-g" - Makes bsd.gdb along with bsd. This is
       useful for debugging crash dumps with gdb. NOTE: This option also
       turns on option DEBUG
     * DEBUG - Used to put various debugging options in the kernel, where
       the source has defined them.
     * KTRACE - Adds hooks for the system call tracing facility. Which
       allows users to use [24]ktrace(1).
     * DIAGNOSTIC - Adds code to the kernel that does internal
       consistency checks.
     * GPROF - adds code to the kernel for kernel profiling with
       [25]kgmon(8).
     * makeoptions PROF="-pg" - The -pg flag causes the kernel to be
       compiled with support for profiling. Option GPROF is required to
       use this option.

   Filesystem Options.
     * FFS - Berkeley Fast Filesystem NOTE: This option is required
     * EXT2FS - Second Extended File System, This is needed for those of
       you who want to read Linux partitions.
     * MFS - Memory File System that stores files in swapable memory.
     * NFS - Network File System, This is needed if you will be using
       NFS.
     * CD9660 - This is iso9660 + rockridge filesystem. This is required
       to read from cd's
     * MSDOSFS - Needed to read MS-DOS FAT filesystems. Also has support
       for Windows 95 long name + mixed case extensions.
     * FDESC - Includes code for a file system which can be mounted on
       /dev/fd

       file system (normally mounted on /kern) in which files
       representing various kernel variables and parameters may be found.
     * NULLFS - Code to have a loopback filesystem. [26]mount_null(8) has
       more information
     * PROCFS - Includes code for a special file system (conventionally
       mounted on /proc)
     * PORTAL - Includes the (experimental) portal filesystem. This
       permits interesting tricks like opening TCP sockets by opening
       files in the file system.
     * UMAPFS - Includes a loopback file system in which user and group
       ids may be remapped -- this can be useful when mounting alien file
       systems with different uids and gids than the local system (eg,
       remote NFS).
     * UNION - Includes code for the union file system, which permits
       directories to be mounted on top of each other in such a way that
       both file systems remain visible. This code isn't quite stable
       yet.
     * XFS - Add hooks for using a filesystem that is compatible with the
       AFS filesystem. Currently used by the Arla/AFS code.
     * LFS - Log Structured Filesystem.
     * FFS_SOFTUPDATES - Allows for the use of softupdates. To read up on
       softupdates more read the [27]Softupdates FAQ section.
     * NFSSERVER - Allow for the server-side NFS code to be included in
       the kernel.
     * NFSCLIENT - Allow for the client-side NFS code to be included in
       the kernel.

     * NVNODE=integer - Where integer is the size of the cache used by
       the name-to-inode translation routines, (a.k.a. the namei() cache,
       though called by many other names in the kernel source).
     * EXT2FS_SYSTEM_FLAG - This option changes the behavior of the
       APPEND and IMMUTABLE flags for a file on an EXT2FS filesystem.
       Read [28]options(4) for more details.

5.3 - Building your own kernel

   Full instructions for creating your own custom kernel are in the
   [41]afterboot(8) man page.

   To compile your kernel from the cdrom you need to first have the
   source code available. You just need the kernel source to be able to
   compile the kernel, and this source code is available on the cd. Here
   is how to copy the sources from the cd. This example assumes that CD1
   is mounted on /mnt.
# mkdir -p /usr/src/sys
# cd /mnt/sys
# tar cf - . | ( cd /usr/src/sys; tar xvf - )

   Now to create your custom kernel it is easiest to start with the
   GENERIC kernel. This is located at
   /usr/src/sys/arch/${arch}/conf/GENERIC, where ${arch} is your
   architecture. There are other sample configurations available in that
   directory as well. Here are two examples for compiling your kernel.
   The first example is compiling your kernel on a read-only source tree.
   The second on a writeable source tree.
# cd /somewhere
# cp /usr/src/sys/arch/$ARCH/conf/SOMEFILE .
# vi SOMEFILE (to make the changes you want)
# config -s /usr/src/sys -b . SOMEFILE
        # make depend
        (The above step is necessary when you have made any changes
            [including updates and patches] to your kernel source tree.
            This step can be ignored if you follow the next step.)
       OR # make clean

   (The above step is necessary if you make changes to your kernel
       configuration options, and is also recommended if you make major
       updates to your source tree. You can ignore this step otherwise,
       and just use 'make depend'.)

   # make

   To compile a kernel inside a writeable source tree do the following:
# cd /sys/arch/$ARCH/conf
# vi SOMEFILE (to make any changes you want)
# config SOMEFILE (read more about it here : [42]config(8))
# cd ../compile/SOMEFILE
# make

   Where $ARCH is the architecture you are using (e.g. i386). You can
   also do a make depend to make the dependencies for the next time you
   compile your kernel.

   To move your kernel into place.
# cp /bsd /bsd.old
# cp /sys/arch/$ARCH/compile/SOMEFILE/bsd /bsd

   To revert to your old kernel at boot you need to just
boot> bsd.old

   and your old kernel will be loaded instead of /bsd.

   Sometimes when you build a new kernel you will be required to install
   new bootblocks. To do so, read [43]faq15.8 on OpenBSD's Bootloader.
   Which will give you an overview on using OpenBSD's Bootloader

5.4 - Boot Time Configuration

   Sometimes when booting your system you might notice that the kernel
   finds your device but maybe at the wrong IRQ. And maybe you need to
   use this device right away. Well, without rebuilding the kernel you
   can use OpenBSD's boot time kernel configuration. This will only
   correct your problem for one time. If you reboot, you will have to
   repeat this procedure. So, this is only meant as a temporary fix, and
   you should correct the problem by fixing and recompiling your kernel.
   Your kernel does however need option BOOT_CONFIG in the kernel, which
   GENERIC does have.

   Most of this document can be found in the man page [44]boot_config(8)
   To boot into the User Kernel Config, or UKC, at boot time us the -c
   option.
boot> boot wd0a:/bsd -c

   Or whichever kernel it is you want to boot. Doing this will bring up a
   UKC prompt. From here you can issue commands directly to the kernel
   specifying devices you want to change or disable or even enable.

   Here is a list of common commands in the UKC.

   add device - Add a device through copying another

   change devno | device - Modify one or more devices

   disable devno | device - Disable one or more devices

   enable devno | device - Enable one or more devices

   find devno | device - Find one or more devices

   help - Short summary of these commands

   list - List ALL known devices

   exit/quit - Continue Booting

   show [attr [val]] - Show devices with an attribute and optional with a
   specified value

   Once you get your device configured, use quit or exit and continue
   booting. After doing so you should correct your Kernel configuration
   and Compile a new kernel. Refer to [45]Building your own kernel for
   help.

5.5 - Getting more verbose output during boot

   Getting more verbose output can be very helpful when trying to debug
   problems when booting. If you have a problem wherein your boot floppy
   won't boot and need to get more information, simply reboot. When you
   get to the "boot>" prompt, boot with boot -c. This will bring you into
   the UKC>, then do:
UKC> verbose
autoconf verbose enabled
UKC> quit

   Now you will be given extremely verbose output upon boot.

5.6 - Using config(8) to change your kernel

   With 2.6 came the introduction of the -e and -u options with
   [46]config(8). These options can be extremely helpful and save wasted
   time compiling your kernel. The -e flag allows you to enter the UKC or
   User Kernel Config on a running system. These changes will then take
   place on your next reboot. The -u flag tests to see if any changes
   were made to the running kernel during boot. Meaning you used boot -c
   to enter the UKC while booting your system.

   The following example shows the disabling of the ep* devices from the
   kernel. For safety's sake you must use the -o option which writes the
   changes out to the file specified. For example : config -e -o bsd.new
   /bsd will write the changes to bsd.new. The example doesn't use the -o
   option, therefore changes are just ignored, and not written back to
   the kernel binary. For more information pertaining to error and
   warning messages read the [47]config(8) man page.
$ sudo config -e /bsd

   In the above example, all ep* devices are removed from the kernel and
   will not be probed. In some situations where you have used the UKC
   during boot, via boot -c, you will need these changes to be written
   out permanently. To do this you need to use the -u option. In the
   following example, the computer was booted into the UKC and the wi(4)
   device was disabled. Since changes made with boot -c are NOT
   permanent, these changes must be written out. This example writes the
   changes made from boot -c into a new kernel binary bsd.new.

6.0.1 - Before we go any further

   For the bulk of this document, it helps if you have read and at least
   partially understand the [9]Kernel Configuration and Setup section of
   the FAQ, and the [10]ifconfig(8) and [11]netstat(1) man pages.

   If you are a network administrator, and you are setting up routing
   protocols, if you are using your OpenBSD box as a router, if you need
   to go in depth into IP networking, you really need to read
   [12]Understanding IP addressing. This is an excellent document.
   Understanding IP addressing contains fundamental knowledge to build
   upon when working with IP networks!

   If you are working with applications such as web servers, ftp servers,
   and mail servers, you may benefit greatly by [13]reading the RFCs. Of
   course, you can't read all of them. Rather, pick some topics that you
   are interested in, or that you use in your work environment. Look them
   up, find out how they are intended to work. The RFCs define many
   (thousands) of standards for protocols on the internet and how they
   are supposed to work.

6.1 - Initial Network Setup

   Table Of Contents
     * [14]6.1.1 - Identifying and Setting Up Your Network Interfaces
     * [15]6.1.2 - Setting up your OpenBSD box as a Gateway

  6.1.1 - Identifying and Setting Up Your Network Interfaces

   To start off, you must first identify your network interface. In
   OpenBSD, interfaces are named for the type of card, not for the type
   of connection. You can see your network card get initialized during
   boot, or after boot using the dmesg(8) command. You also have the
   ability of seeing your network interface using the ifconfig(8)
   command. For example, Here is the output in dmesg for a ne2k network
   card, which uses the device name ne*.
ne3 at pcmcia1 function 0 "Linksys, EtherFast 10/100 PC Card (PCMPC100), " port
 0x340/16 irq 9
ne3: address 00:e0:98:04:95:ba

   If you don't know what your device name is, here is a list of common
   cards and their device names.
     * ne2000 Network Cards - [16]ne*
     * 3Com EtherLink III and Fast EtherLink III Ethernet - [17]ep*
     * 3Com EtherLink XL and Fast EtherLink XL Ethernet (3C9xx) - [18]xl*
     * Intel 82586 chip Ethernet device driver - [19]ie*
        Which Includes Cards Such As:
          + 3Com 3C507
          + AT&T StarLAN 10
          + AT&T EN100
          + AT&T StarLan Fiber
          + Intel EtherExpress 16

   Again, you can check to see what interfaces have been identified by
   using the ifconfig(8) utility. Here is output which will show an ne2k
   device.
$ ifconfig -a
lo0: flags=8009<UP,LOOPBACK,MULTICAST>
        inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000
lo1: flags=8008<LOOPBACK,MULTICAST>
ne3: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,NOTRAILERS,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST>
        media: Ethernet manual
        inet 10.0.0.38 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.0.255
sl0: flags=c010<POINTOPOINT,LINK2,MULTICAST>
sl1: flags=c010<POINTOPOINT,LINK2,MULTICAST>
ppp0: flags=8010<POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST>
ppp1: flags=8010<POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST>
tun0: flags=10<POINTOPOINT>
tun1: flags=10<POINTOPOINT>
enc0: flags=0<>
bridge0: flags=0<>
bridge1: flags=0<>

   As you can see here, ifconfig(8) gives us alot more information than
   we are needing at this point. But it still allows us to see our
   interface. In the above example, the interface card is already
   configured. You can tell this by seeing that vaulues are already set
   in "inet 10.0.0.38 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.0.255", and that
   the UP and RUNNING flags are turned on. Also, you will notice many
   other interfaces. Here is a list of interfaces that will be expected
   to be there.
     * [20]lo* - Loopback Interface
     * [21]sl* - Slip Network Interface
     * ppp* - Point to Point Protocol
     * [22]tun* - Tunnel Network Interface
     * [23]enc* - Encapsulating Interface
     * [24]bridge* - Ethernet bridge interface

   If you don't have your interface configured the first step is to
   create the /etc/hostname.${IF} file. Where the name of your interface
   will take the place of ${IF}. From the information in the examples
   above, the name would be /etc/hostname.ne3. The layout of this file is
   like so: To read more about the format of this file, reference the
   [25]hostname.if(5) man page.
[address_family] [your_ip] [your_netmask] [media options]

   So for the above example, a proper file would look like this:
$ cat /etc/hostname.ne3
inet 10.0.0.38 255.255.255.0 NONE

   Next step from here is to setup your gateway. To do this, simply put
   the IP of your gateway in the file /etc/mygate. This will allow for
   your gateway to be set upon boot. From here you should setup your
   nameservers, and your /etc/hosts file. To setup your nameservers, you
   will create a file called /etc/resolv.conf. You can read more about
   the format of this file in the [26]resolv.conf(5) man page. But for a
   standard usage, here is an example. In this example your domain
   servers are 125.2.3.4 and 125.2.3.5. You also belong in the domain
   "yourdomain.com".
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
search yourdomain.com
nameserver 125.2.3.4
nameserver 125.2.3.5
lookup file bind

   From here, you can either reboot or run the /etc/netstart script. You
   can do this by simply Typing (as root):
$ sh /etc/netstart
$ sudo sh /etc/netstart
writing to routing socket: File exists
add net 127: gateway 127.0.0.1: File exists
writing to routing socket: File exists
add net 224.0.0.0: gateway 127.0.0.1: File exists

   Notice that a few errors were produced, but this is in regards to the
   loopback interface. So this can be ignored. From here your system
   should be up and running. Again you can check to make sure that your
   interface was setup correctly with ifconfig(8). You can also check
   your routes via netstat(1) or route(8). Here is an example of viewing
   your routing tables using both.
$ netstat -rn
Routing tables

  6.1.2 - Setting up your OpenBSD box as a Gateway

   This is the basic information you need to set up your OpenBSD box as a
   gateway (also called a router). If you are using OpenBSD as a router
   on the Internet, we suggest that you also read the IP Filter setup
   instructions below to block potentially malicious traffic. Also, due
   to the low availability of IPv4 addresses from network service
   providers and regional registries, you may want to look at Network
   Address Translation for information on conserving your IP address
   space.

   The GENERIC kernel is already has the ability to allow IP Forwarding,
   but needs to be turned on. You should do this using the sysctl(8)
   utility. To change this permanently you should edit the file
   /etc/sysctl.conf to allow for IP Forwarding. To do so add this line in
   that configuration file.
net.inet.ip.forwarding=1

   To make this change without rebooting you would use the sysctl(8)
   utility directly. Remember though that this change will not still
   exist after a reboot, and needs to be run as root.
# sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
net.inet.ip.forwarding: 0 -> 1

   Now modify the routes on the other hosts on both sides. There are many
   possible uses of OpenBSD as a router, using software such as
   [27]routed(8), [28]gated, [29]mrtd, and [30]zebra. OpenBSD has support
   in the ports collection for both gated and mrtd. OpenBSD supports
   several T1, HSSI, ATM, FDDI, Ethernet, and serial (PPP/SLIP)
   interfaces.

6.2 - IP Filter

   The IP Filter package was created to handle two tasks, dealing with
   packet level forwarding permissions [31]ipf(8) and mapping
   hosts/subnets to a range of external addresses [32]ipnat(8). The
   configuration files for these two services are /etc/ipf.rules and
   /etc/ipnat.rules.

   You need to edit /etc/rc.conf to activate them at boot time. You also
   need to have net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 in your /etc/sysctl.conf (or
   your kernel needs to have IPFORWARDING or GATEWAY options turned on.)
   You also need a kernel compiled with option IPFILTER and IPFILTER_LOG
   (the GENERIC kernels do have these options).

   If you have IP Filter compiled into your kernel, but you don't have it
   turned on in your /etc/rc.conf file, you can still activate it easily.
# ipf -Fa -f /etc/ipf.rules -E
# ipnat -CF -f /etc/ipnat.rules

   The -E flag on ipf 'enables' IP Filter. -Fa clears out any rules that
   you may have in there. -f /etc/ipf.rules loads the rules from
   /etc/ipf.rules.

   If you make changes to /etc/ipf.rules after ipf is loaded, you can
   reload your rules pretty easily!
# ipf -Fa -f /etc/ipf.rules

   Same for ipnat...
# ipnat -CF -f /etc/ipnat.rules

   This document will cover some basic ipf and ipnat configurations
   below. There are a lot of nice examples in /usr/share/ipf/ for ipnat
   and ipf. We recommend you choose the one closest to what you want, and
   modify it to fit your needs. You can find other IP Filter information
   at the IP Filter [33]mailing list archive, the [34]IP Filter web site,
   and finally the [35]IP Filter HOWTO.

  IPF

   In order to enable ipf at boot, you will need to modify /etc/rc.conf
   so it reads IPFILTER=YES. IP Filter (ipf) is controlled by
   /etc/ipf.rules, which is read at boot. For a more detailed
   explanation, see [36]ipf(5). In the examples that follow, fxp0 will
   represent the external interface to the internet. It will be different
   for you, based on the ethernet adaptor present in your computer. These
   rules will assume full-time internet connectivity, such as you would
   see on a webserver.

   IP Filter rules are processed sequentially from top to bottom, it
   helps to visualize each packet having to traverse every rule before it
   reaches it's destination.

   For example, the default ruleset provided allows all packets to travel
   in, and all packets to travel out:
pass out from any to any
pass in from any to any

   Now lets say we don't want to allow any incoming connections to port
   3306 (mysql) because the database should only be connected to from
   localhost. Our ruleset would look like this:
pass out from any to any
pass in from any to any
block in on fxp0 from any to any port = 3306

   This says "block in all incoming packets, from anywhere to anywhere
   whose destination is 3306." Essentially a packet destined for port
   3306 on interface fxp0 will pass the first "pass in" rule and then be
   dropped by the "block in port = 3306" rule. If you reversed the order
   of our incoming rules (remember, order is important):
pass out from any to any
block in on fxp0 from any to any port = 3306
pass in from any to any

   Packets destined for port 3306 would pass because the last rule in the
   set allows all packets to pass. It is important to keep this in mind
   when writing packet filter rules: The last matching rule wins.

   Of course, there are exceptions to every rule. the quick option drops
   the packet at the first rule that matches. Let's look at our above
   flawed example, if we add quick to the "block in" rule:
pass out from any to any
block in quick on fxp0 from any to any port = 3306
pass in from any to any

   A packet destined for our host on port 3306 will hit the "block in
   quick" rule and be dropped immediately. All packets destined for other
   ports wont find a rule match until they reach our "pass in" rule that
   allows all packets to pass.
   Default Deny

   The safest packet filtering policy is a default deny policy. All
   traffic not explicitly allowed is denied. This policy is far safer
   than explicitly denying each protected service, allows for smaller
   rulesets, and can protect from an accidentally misconfigured service
   that has been left exposed.

   Let's now look at another real world example ruleset and explain
   things line by line. Here's an example for a webserver with a default
   deny policy that only allows ssh connections (for administration) and
   connections to http (port 80) and https (port 443).
#############################
# begin ruleset
#############################
pass in quick on fxp0 from any to any port = 22
pass in quick on fxp0 from any to any port = 80
pass in quick on fxp0 from any to any port = 443
block in quick on fxp0 from any to any
pass out on fxp0 from any to any
##############################
# end ruleset
##############################

   This will allow incoming connections from anywhere to ports 22(ssh),
   80(http), and 443(https). It will drop all other connection attempts,
   and allow all outgoing connections. This is a pretty tight ruleset.
   But what if you only wanted to allow internal hosts on your 1.1.1.0
   address block to connect to ssh, but allow outside connections to http
   and https?
#############################
# begin ruleset
#############################
pass in quick on fxp0 from 1.1.1.0/24 to any port = 22
pass in quick on fxp0 from any to any port = 80
pass in quick on fxp0 from any to any port = 443
block in quick on fxp0 from any to any
pass out on fxp0 from any to any
##############################
# end ruleset
##############################

   Pretty good, but what if we only want to allow one machine (1.1.1.1)
   to administer the web server remotely? In that case, we can change
   this:
pass in quick on fxp0 from 1.1.1.0/24 to any port = 22

   to this:
pass in quick on fxp0 from 1.1.1.1/32 to any port = 22

   IP Filter supports both CIDR and dotted decimal forms of netmask
   address. You could also write the above as:
pass in quick on fxp0 from 1.1.1.1/255.255.255.255 to any port = 22

   but why would you? Sample Rules

   Here are some good rules for everyone to use (assuming that fxp0 is
   the external internet-connected interface). First we will set up
   simple address spoofing protection.
block in quick on fxp0 from 127.0.0.0/8 to any
block in quick on fxp0 from 192.168.0.0/16 to any
block in quick on fxp0 from 172.16.0.0/12 to any
block in quick on fxp0 from 10.0.0.0/8 to any
block out quick on fxp0 from any to 127.0.0.1/8
block out quick on fxp0 from any to 192.168.0.0/16
block out quick on fxp0 from any to 172.16.0.0/12
block out quick on fxp0 from any to 10.0.0.0/8

   It's also a good idea to separate your loopback interface from your
   other rules.
pass out quick on lo0
pass in quick on lo0

   Our ruleset is starting to look pretty good, when we put it together,
   here's what it looks like:
###########################
# begin ruleset
###########################
# loopback rules

pass out quick on lo0
pass in quick on lo0

# don't allow anyone to spoof non-routeable addresses

block in quick on fxp0 from 127.0.0.0/8 to any
block in quick on fxp0 from 192.168.0.0/16 to any
block in quick on fxp0 from 172.16.0.0/12 to any
block in quick on fxp0 from 10.0.0.0/8 to any
block out quick on fxp0 from any to 127.0.0.1/8
block out quick on fxp0 from any to 192.168.0.0/16
block out quick on fxp0 from any to 172.16.0.0/12
block out quick on fxp0 from any to 10.0.0.0/8

# only allow our administration machine to connect via ssh

pass in quick on fxp0 from 1.1.1.1/32 to any port = 22

# allow others to use http and https

pass in quick on fxp0 from any to any port = 80
pass in quick on fxp0 from any to any port = 443

# finally lock the rest down with a default deny

block in quick on fxp0 from any to any

# and let out-going traffic out

pass out on fxp0 from any to any

#############################
# end ruleset
#############################

   Packet logging

   Now that's pretty good, but it could be better. What if we want to log
   any connection attempts to port 22(ssh) that get blocked by our
   firewall? Easy, IP Filter can handle this with the log keyword:
pass in quick on fxp0 from 1.1.1.1/32 to any port = 22
block in log quick on fxp0 from any to any port = 22

   This rule will allow our remote administration machine to connect to
   port 22, but deny and log all other attempts to connect to port 22.
   Protocol based packet filtering

   IP Filter can also filter based on the protocol it is filtering, in
   fact, IP Filter can filter any protocol listed in [37]/etc/protocols.
   For the sake of clarity, we will only concern ourselves with tcp, udp,
   and icmp.

   In order for ipf to filter based on protocol, the keyword proto must
   be used. To examine our earlier ssh example rule, since ssh runs over
   tcp, we should only allow tcp packets to connect. by using the proto
   keyword to allow only tcp, we get a rule that looks like this:
pass in quick on fxp0 proto tcp from 1.1.1.1/32 to any port = 22

   But what if we need to allow connections to a service running over
   both tcp and udp like bind? Well, in the case of tcp/udp, IP Filter
   allows you to group both protocols together. Note: this only applies
   to tcp/udp. Using the bind example, a rule allowing tcp and udp
   connections in a default deny environment would look like:
pass in quick on fxp0 proto tcp/udp from any to any port = 53

   Packet Filtering Voodoo

   In addition to filtering based on protocol, IP Filter is also capable
   of managing fragmented IP packets (a common method of defeating packet
   filters). There are two possible keywords that can be used when
   dealing with fragmented ip packets, frag for commonly fragmented IP
   packets, or short for IP packets with headers too small for
   comparison. Since fragmented packets can occur normally, depending on
   link conditions, it is best to only filter packets with headers too
   small for valid comparison. This can be accomplished with the
   following rule:
block in quick proto tcp all with short

   What about IP Options? IP Filter can handle those packets too. Packets
   can either be dropped if they have IP options set, or they can be
   dropped based on the specific IP options that are set. For example,
   the following rule will drop and log all packets with ip options set.
block in log quick on fxp0 all with ipopts

   This may however break some things such as [38]traceroute(8). You can
   also specify which options not to allow. For instance a good rule is
   to block all packets with source routing options. This is accomplished
   with this rule:
block in quick on fxp0 all with opt lsrr

   TCP Flags, established connections and keeping state

   Now the IP Filter voodoo begins in earnest. IP Filter's greatest
   strengths are it's ability to filter packets based on TCP flags and to
   maintain established connections and connection state. It is recommend
   that all users who wish to filter packets based on TCP flags
   understand what role each flag plays. For instance, if you wanted to
   deny all packets with the FIN, URG, and PSH flags set (like for
   instance an nmap OS fingerprinting attempt) you could use a rule like
   this:
block in quick proto tcp on fxp0 from any to any flags FUP

   (Thanks to [39]Kyle Hargraves for that tip)

   IP Filter's next cool trick is it's ability to maintain state.
   Maintaining state has been described as "not speaking until spoken
   to", in other words, once a connection is established, packets no
   longer have to traverse rulesets. This is a very powerful feature
   allowing much simpler and more secure rule writing.

   For example, let's see how we can apply state to our previous example
   ruleset (confused yet?). To review, we are allowing management access
   from our Class C to port 22(ssh) and allowing all incoming web traffic
   on ports 80(http) and 443(https). We are blocking all other traffic.
   But what if I want to ssh out of the webserver? What if I need to use
   lynx to look up something in the FAQ? Well, I can't because I have
   blocked all incoming connections other than on the specified ports.
   While this is the safest route, it can be quite inconvenient. By
   adding the keep state keywords to our "pass out" rule, we can
   automagically allow incoming connections in response to connections we
   initiate, such as when web browsing.
#############################
# begin ruleset
#############################
pass in quick on fxp0 from 1.1.1.0/24 to any port = 22
pass in quick on fxp0 from any to any port = 80
pass in quick on fxp0 from any to any port = 443
block in quick on fxp0 from any to any
pass out on fxp0 from any to any keep state
##############################
# end ruleset
##############################

   This little change will dramatically increase the flexibility and
   security of our ruleset because it allows us to do some funky voodoo.
   For instance, in the above ruleset, we are allowing all tcp traffic
   into ports 80 & 443. We can tighten this up even more. In order for a
   tcp connection to be established, we only need to allow the initial
   handshake to occur, once that occurs, we can block traffic to that
   port and allow our "keep state" rule to manage the connection. To
   allow the initial handshake to complete, we need only allow packets
   with the SIN and SIN/ACK flags set. By passing only packets with SIN
   and SIN/ACK set, we can prevent many forms of portscanning such as FIN
   scanning. The rules now look like this:
#############################
# begin ruleset
#############################
pass in quick on fxp0 from 1.1.1.0/24 to any port = 22
pass in quick on fxp0 from any to any port = 80 flags S/SA
pass in quick on fxp0 from any to any port = 443 flags S/SA
block in quick on fxp0 from any to any
pass out on fxp0 from any to any keep state
##############################
# end ruleset
##############################

   Let's wrap this up by putting all of the rules we have so far into a
   ruleset. This ruleset will have a default deny policy, allow
   management connections from an internal network only (via ssh) and
   allow incoming traffic on ports 80(http) and 443(https). It will also
   protect against spoofed non-routeable ip addresses, and drop all
   packets that are too fragmented to inspect. A pretty comprehensive
   setup for a public webserver. Here's what /etc/ipf.rules should look
   like:
###########################
# begin ruleset
###########################
# loopback rules
pass out quick on lo0
pass in quick on lo0

# drop itsy bitsy frags
block in quick proto tcp all with short

# drop source routed packets
block in quick on fxp0 all with opt lsrr
block in quick on fxp0 all with opt ssrr

# don't allow anyone to spoof non-routeable addresses
block in quick on fxp0 from 127.0.0.0/8 to any
block in quick on fxp0 from 192.168.0.0/16 to any
block in quick on fxp0 from 172.16.0.0/12 to any
block in quick on fxp0 from 10.0.0.0/8 to any
block out quick on fxp0 from any to 127.0.0.1/8
block out quick on fxp0 from any to 192.168.0.0/16
block out quick on fxp0 from any to 172.16.0.0/12
block out quick on fxp0 from any to 10.0.0.0/8

# only allow our machines to connect via ssh
pass in quick on fxp0 from 1.1.1.0/24 to any port = 22

# allow others to use http and https
pass in quick on fxp0 from any to any port = 80 flags S/SA
pass in quick on fxp0 from any to any port = 443 flags S/SA

# finally lock the rest down with a default deny
block in quick on fxp0 from any to any

# and let out-going traffic out and maintain state on established connections
pass out on fxp0 from any to any keep state

#############################
# end ruleset

  6.3.1 Introduction

   Purpose

   The purpose of this document is to explain and give and overview of
   installing and configuring Network Address Translation ("NAT") on an
   OpenBSD machine. This document is meant for users with a beginning to
   intermediate level of knowledge in UNIX, TCP/IP, and networking
   technologies. The user is assumed to have already set up and
   configured an OpenBSD machine with two network cards (one connected to
   the Internet and the other to the local network).

   Based on [58]RFC 1631, ipnat provides an easy way to map internal
   networks to a single routeable ("real") internet address. This is very
   useful if you don't have officially assigned addresses for every host
   on your internal network. When you set up private/internal networks,
   you can take advantage of reserved address blocks (assigned in [59]RFC
   1918), such as:

   10.0.0.0/8 (10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255)
   172.16.0.0/12 (172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255)
   192.168.0.0/16 (192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255)
   Terminology

   The conventions used in this document are fairly straightforward. For
   documentation purposes I will review some of the terms and format for
   which this document adheres to.
   "NAT"
       This describes the function of "Network Address Translation." The
       process of NAT is described later in this document.

   "ipnat"
       This is short for "IP Network Address Translation." In-and-of
       itself, it can be used interchangeably with NAT. However, in this
       document the term "ipnat" will be used solely for command-line
       only use.

   "IPF"
       This is short for "IP Filter." IP Filter is a portable packet
       filtering software that is included as part of OpenBSD. IP Filter
       must be enabled before you can turn on ipnat. This is easy, just
       edit /etc/rc.conf and change ipf=NO to ipf=YES. That only changes
       it for the boot up sequence, you also need to do 'ipf -E' to turn
       on ipf while you are booted. Of course, this is described further,
       below.

   Configuration

   This is how the computers are setup concerning this document. Your
   setup will vary from this, but the purpose of the document is to give
   you an overview so you can conform this information to your setup.
   Computer Operating System: OpenBSD v2.5 i386
       NICs:

   NetGear 10/100MB pn0
       Connected to the EXTERNAL LAN (or WAN)
       IP Address: 24.5.0.5
       Netmask: 255.255.255.0
       NetGear 10/100MB pn1
       Connected to the INTERNAL LAN
       IP Address: 192.168.1.1
       Netmask: 255.255.255.0

   External, Internet-routeable IP (provided by ISP, in this example, a
   cable modem prodiver)
   IP Address: 24.5.0.5
       Netmask: 255.255.255.0
       Gateway: 24.5.0.1

   Local Area Network
   In this example, machines on the LAN use the IP addressing scheme
       192.168.1.xxx (where xxx is a unique number). There are a variety
       of different operating systems on the internal LAN including
       Windows 98, Windows NT, OpenBSD and Linux. Each machine is
       connected to a hub that is designated for internal use. For this
       document and its examples the client on the LAN will assume IP
       address 192.168.1.40

  6.3.2 Network Address Translation

   Introduction to NAT

   As more and more businesses and users get on the Internet, each one
   must have an IP address. Public IP addresses are becoming harder and
   harder to get. The solution for a lot of people has been Network
   Address Translation (or "NAT"). NAT is a very simple, yet powerful way
   to get your LAN connected to the Internet without having to purchase
   or lease IP addresses for each machine. NAT is also known as "IP
   Masquerading" if you're a Linux user.

   When NAT is up and running correctly, it allows users on the internal
   LAN to access the Internet through a different IP address (the one you
   set up with your provider). Each machine on the LAN uses the one IP
   address (transparently) of the one machine that is set up to use the
   ISP assigned IP address.

   The way NAT works is amazingly simple. When a client on the LAN wants
   to connect to a machine on the Internet, it sends out a TCP packet
   with a request to connect. Inside the TCP packet header is the
   client's IP address (i.e. 192.168.1.40) and the requested host's IP
   address (i.e. 123.45.67.89). The machine running NAT intercepts this
   TCP packet and changes the client's IP address from 192.168.1.40 to
   the IP address of the Internet-connected machine (i.e. 24.5.0.5). This
   effectively tricks the host machine into thinking the actual
   connection is from the NAT machine, not the actual client's machine.
   The host then sends back responses to the NAT machine like it was the
   one connecting. When the NAT machine receives the responses it quickly
   translates the destination IP address back from itself to the client's
   machine and sends the packet to the client. The client didn't have any
   idea of what happened and spoofed Internet connectivity is totally
   transparent.

   The example below shows NAT a little more clearly:
Client ----------------- pn1 [ NAT ] pn0 ---------- Internet Host
192.168.1.40 --- 192.168.1.1 [ NAT ] 24.5.0.5 --- 123.45.67.89

OUTGOING TCP Packet                     OUTGOING TCP Packet
From: 192.168.1.40  >>=== NAT ===>>     From: 24.5.0.5
To: 123.45.67.89                        To: 123.45.67.89

INCOMING TCP Packet                     INCOMING TCP Packet
From: 123.45.67.89                      From: 123.45.67.89
To:   192.168.1.40  <<=== NAT ===<<     To: 24.5.0.5

   Why to use NAT

   When presented with a cable modem in my new apartment I was also
   presented with another minor problem. How to get Internet access to my
   roommates, when the cable modem resides in my room? There were a few
   options I could implement ranging from obtaining extra IP addresses,
   to setting up a proxy server, to setting up NAT. (Don't let the cable
   modem example fool you. NAT is powerful enough to masquerade a large
   network with hundreds or even thousands of computers!)

   There are many reasons why I wanted to set up NAT. The number one
   reason is for saving money. There are two roommates in my house (each
   with their own PC) and myself with 3 computers. My ISP only allows for
   three IP addresses per household. This means that there weren't enough
   IPs to allow every machine internet access.

   By using NAT each machine will have a unique (internal) IP address but
   share the one IP address given to me by my ISP. The cost goes down.
   Setup

   In order to enable NAT on your OpenBSD machine you will need to turn
   on IPF and NAT. This is easily accomplished by editing the files
   listed below (make the changes to the file so it looks like the
   options below):

   /etc/rc.conf (this file used to start services at boot time)
   ipfilter=YES
       ipnat=YES

   /etc/sysctl.conf
   net.inet.ip.forwarding=1

   After these changes are made, the machine is now ready to for the
   configuration of NAT.
   Configuration

   The first step is to configure the IPF rules file (/etc/ipf.rules).
   For the purposes of this document we will allow traffic to pass
   through this firewall option without any interference. The file should
   look like this:
pass in from any to any
pass out from any to any

   Again for more information you can read [60]FAQ 6.2

   The NAT configuration file (/etc/ipnat.rules) has a very simple
   syntax. For the configuration set forth above, the file should contain
   the following entry:
map pn0 192.168.1.0/24 -> 24.5.0.5/32 portmap tcp/udp 10000:60000
map pn0 192.168.1.0/24 -> 24.5.0.5/32

   Here is an explaination for the above lines.
   "map"
       This is the command you are giving ipnat. It is telling ipnat that
       this entry is an entry to change IP addresses between the LAN and
       the Internet.

   "pn0"
       This is the network interface that is connected to the Internet.

   "192.168.1.0/24"
       the IP address and netmask (the netmask is in CIDR format).
       Combined they state "any IP address of value 192.168.1.1 through
       192.168.1.254" should be mapped. If you would prefer not to use
       CIDR notation you can substitute "/24" for "/255.255.255.0".

   "24.5.0.5/32"
       This IP address and netmask state the IP address that the LAN IP
       addresses will be mapped to. /32 means one single IP address. You
       can also map to a /24, or 256 IP addresses (or a /27, or whatever
       number of bits you'd like)!! This is useful if you have several
       thousand client machines behind your NAT.... (Of course, this is
       only useful if that /24 is being routed to your OpenBSD box!)

   "portmap tcp/udp 10000:60000"
       This maps all tcp/udp packets to ports in the range of 10000 to
       60000.

   The second line has almost the same entry except for the last portion.
   This tells ipnat to map anything else (not tcp/udp, those packets are
   already matched by the first line) to whatever port it requests (used
   for ICMP, and other protcols). Once this is in the file, all that's
   needed is to run the IPF daemon.
   Running

   Executing NAT is a very simple process also. Once the configuration is
   complete, there are two ways to enable NAT. The first (and best way if
   possible-to test the setup stage) is to reboot your OpenBSD machine.
   This is accomplished with the command "reboot"

   If you would like to run ipnat from the command line, use the
   following commands:
# ipf -Fa -f /etc/ipf.rules -E
# ipnat -CF -f /etc/ipnat.rules

   The first line is to enable IPF (remember that NAT piggy-backs on IPF
   therefore IPF must be initialized and running before NAT can be
   loaded). The options on the command line "-Fa" clear out any existing
   entries already in effect. "-f /etc/ipf.rules" tells ipf where the
   rules file can be found. "-E" is the switch to enable the IPF daemon.

   The second command line is to enable NAT. "-CF" clears and flushes all
   existing entries in the NAT table. "-f /etc/ipnat.rules" tells NAT
   where the NAT rules file is at. NAT is now running. It's as simple as
   that.

   Note: in order to reload the NAT settings (in case you edit the file
   but don't want to reboot) just execute the 2nd command over again. The
   settings will be flushed and reloaded.

  6.3.3 Nat Knowledge Base

   Checking NAT Status

   To find out how NAT is doing or make sure the settings have taken
   effect, you use the "-l" option. This option will list all the
   settings and current sessions that ipnat is running:
# ipnat -l
map pn0 192.168.1.0/24 -> 24.5.0.5/32 portmap tcp/udp 10000:60000
map pn0 192.168.1.0/24 -> 24.5.0.5/32

List of active sessions:
MAP 192.168.1.40  2473  <- -> 24.5.0.5  13463 [129.128.5.191 80]

   The purpose of the first two lines is to confirm the settings that
   were entered in /etc/ipnat.rules earlier. The line(s) below will show
   you a list of the current NAT controlled connections.
   "MAP 192.168.1.40 2473"
       This tells you the IP address of the machine on the LAN that is
       using NAT. The port number used to make the connection is
       displayed afterwards.

   "<- ->"
       This shows that NAT is handling the flow of traffic in both
       directions.

   "24.5.0.5 13463"
       This denotes that the connection is going to the Internet via IP
       address 24.5.0.5 and using port 13463.

   "129.128.5.191 80"
       The IP address and the port being connected to are listed last.

   Limitations of NAT (in FTP)

   There are a few limitations of NAT. One is with FTP. When a user
   connects to a remote FTP server and requests information or file, the
   FTP server will make a connection to the client and transfer the info.
   This is done on a random free port. This is a problem for users
   attempting to gain access to FTP servers from within the LAN. When the
   FTP server sends its information it sends it to the external NIC at a
   random port. The NAT machine will receive this, but because it has no
   mappings for the unknown packet and doesn't have any mappings for that
   port, it will drop the packet and won't deliver it.

   The solution to this is to place yourself in "passive mode" in your
   FTP client. This will tell the server that you want to connect to the
   server, and not what you just read. Then when you make that connection
   out NAT will correctly handle your connection.

   IP Filter provides another solution for this situation, that is, an
   ftp proxy which is built-in to the NAT code. To activate it, put
   something like this before your other NAT mappings.
map pn0 192.168.1.0/24 -> 24.5.0.5/32 proxy port ftp ftp/tcp

   With this in place, the kernel will watch your FTP connections for the
   "PORT" command coming from the ftp client, and it will replace the IP
   address and port with it's own outside IP address, and a port of its
   own choosing. Then it will open up that port and tunnel the data to
   the port your ftp client asked for. Obviously, this is slightly more
   resource intensive. But, unless your NAT/IP Filter box is reaching
   critical mass, you should be fine.

   Redirecting Traffic

   At times you may need to redirect incoming or outgoing traffic for a
   certain protocol or port. A good example of this is if there were a
   server residing inside the LAN running a web server. Incoming
   connections to your valid Internet IP will find that unless your NAT
   box is running a web server, no connection can be made. For this
   purpose we use the NAT 'rdr' directive in the rules file to instruct
   where to redirect (or route) a particular connection to.

   For our example, lets say a web server resides on the LAN with IP
   address of 192.168.1.80. The NAT rules file needs a new directive to
   handle this. Add a line similar to the following one to your
   ipnat.rules:
rdr pn0 24.5.0.5/32 port 80 -> 192.168.1.80 port 80

   The reason for each line is this:
   "rdr"
       This is the command you are giving ipnat. It is telling ipnat that
       this entry is an entry to redirect a connection.

   "pn0"
       This is the network interface that is connected to the Internet.

   "24.5.0.5/32"
       This means an incoming connection to this IP address (only on pn0,
       as above)

   "port 80"
       This is the port (80) that should be redirected. The number "80"
       didn't have to be used. You can use "port www" also to specify a
       redirection of port 80. If you would like to use a name instead of
       a number, the service name and corresponding port, must exist in
       the file /etc/services.

   "192.168.1.80"
       The IP address and netmask of the LAN machine which the packets
       are redirected to. The netmask is always "/32" (and therefore not
       needed to be specified) so the packets can be redirected to a
       particular machine.

   When the addition is complete reload the NAT rules, and the
   redirection will start immediately.
   NAT versus Proxy

   The difference between NAT and an application-based proxy is that the
   proxy software acts as a middle-man between the Internet and the
   machines connected on the LAN. This is fine, however each application
   you want to run on your machine and connect to the Internet through
   the proxy server MUST be proxy-aware (be able to use a proxy server).
   Not all applications are able to do this (especially games).
   Furthermore, there simply are not proxy server applications for all of
   the Internet services out there. NAT transparently maps your internal
   network so that it may connect to the Internet. The only security
   advantage to using a proxy software over NAT is that the proxy
   software may have been made security aware, and can filter based on
   content, to keep your Windows machine from getting a macro virus, it
   can protect against buffer overflows to your client software, and
   more. To maintain these filters is often a high-maintenance job.

6.4 - DHCP

  6.4.1 DHCP Client

   To use the DHCP client [65]dhclient(8) included with OpenBSD, edit
   /etc/hostname.xl0 (this is assuming your main ethernet interface is
   xl0. Yours might be ep0 or fxp0 or something else!) All you need to
   put in this hostname file is 'dhcp'
# echo dhcp >/etc/hostname.xl0

   This will cause OpenBSD to automatically start the DHCP client on
   boot. OpenBSD will gather its IP address, default gateway, and DNS
   servers from the DHCP server.

   If you want to start a dhcp client from the command line, make sure
   /etc/dhclient.conf exists, then try:
# dhclient fxp0

   Where fxp0 is the interface that you want to receive dhcp on.

   No matter how you start the dhclient, you can edit the
   /etc/dhclient.conf file to not update your DNS according to the dhcp
   server's idea of DNS by first uncommenting the 'requre' lines in it
   (they are examples of the default settings, but you need to uncomment
   them to override dhclient's defaults.)
request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers,
      domain-name, domain-name-servers, host-name, lpr-servers, ntp-servers;

   and then remove domain-name-servers. Of course, you may want to remove
   hostname, or other settings too.

  6.4.2 DHCP Server

   If you want to use OpenBSD as a DHCP server [66]dhcpd(8), edit
   /etc/rc.conf. Set it up so that dhcpd_flags="-q" instead of
   dhcpd_flags=NO. Put the interfaces that you want dhcpd to *listen* on
   in /etc/dhcpd.interfaces.
# echo xl1 xl2 xl3 >/etc/dhcpd.interfaces

   Then, edit /etc/dhcpd.conf. The options are pretty self explanatory.
        option  domain-name "xyz.mil";
        option  domain-name-servers 192.168.1.3, 192.168.1.5;

        subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
                option routers 192.168.1.1;

                range 192.168.1.32 192.168.1.127;
        }

   This will tell your dhcp clients that the domain to append to DNS
   requests is xyz.mil (so, if the user types in 'telnet joe' then it
   will send them to joe.xyz.mil). It will point them to DNS servers
   192.168.1.3 and 192.168.1.5. For hosts that are on the same network as
   an ethernet interface on the OpenBSD machine, which is in the
   192.168.1.0/24 range, it will assign them an IP address between
   192.168.1.32 and 192.168.1.127. It will set their default gateway as
   192.168.1.1.

   If you want to start dhcpd from the command line, after editing
   /etc/dhcpd.conf, try:
# dhcpd -q fxp0

   Where fxp0 is an interface that you want to start serving dhcp on. The
   -q flag makes dhcpd quiet, otherwise it is very noisy.

   If you are serving DHCP to a Windows box, you may want to dhcpd to
   give the client a 'WINS' server address. To make this happen, just the
   following line to your /etc/dhcpd.conf:
option  netbios-name-servers    192.168.92.55;

   (where 192.168.92.55 is the IP of your Windows or Samba server.) See
   [67]dhcp-options(5) for more options that your DHCP clients may want.

6.5 - PPP

   Point-to-Protocol is generally what is used to create a connection to
   your ISP via your modem. OpenBSD has 2 ways of doing this.
     * [68]pppd(8) - Which is the kernel ppp daemon.
     * [69]ppp(8) - Which is the userland ppp daemon.

   The first one we will cover will be the userland PPP daemon. To start
   off you will need some simple information about your isp. Here is a
   list of helpful information that you will need.
     * Your ISP's dialup number
     * Your nameserver
     * Your username and password.
     * Your gateway

   Some of these you can do without, but would be helpful in setting up
   your ppp. The userland PPP daemon uses the file [70]/etc/ppp/ppp.conf
   as its configuration file. There are many helpful files in /etc/ppp
   that can have different setups for many different situations. You
   should take a browse though that directory.

   Also, make sure, that if your not using a GENERIC kernel, that you
   have this line in your configuration file:
pseudo-device   tun             2

  Initial Setup - for PPP(8)

   Initial Setup for the userland PPP daemon consists of editing your
   /etc/ppp/ppp.conf file. This file doesn't exist by default, but there
   is a file /etc/ppp/ppp.conf.sample in which you can simply edit to
   create your own ppp.conf file. Here I will start with the simplist
   setup and probobly most used setup. Here is a quick ppp.conf file that
   will simply connect to your ISP and set your default routes and
   nameserver. With this file all the information you need is your ISP's
   phone number and your username and password.
default:
set log Phase Chat LCP IPCP CCP tun command
set device /dev/cua01
set speed 115200
set dial "ABORT BUSY ABORT NO\\sCARRIER TIMEOUT 5 \"\" AT OK-AT-OK ATE1Q0 OK\\d
ATDT\\T TIMEOUT 40 CONNECT"

   NOTICE - On OpenBSD 2.6, the system shipped with a
   /etc/ppp/ppp.conf.example that had an incorrect setting for device.
   The device was "set device /dev/cuaa0". This should be /dev/cua00
   which would correspond to serial device 1. (COM1). Your device might
   not be on COM1, however the nameing scheme was wrong.

   The section under the default: tag will get executed each time. Here
   we setup all our critical information. Here with "set log" we set our
   logging levels. This can be changed, refer to [71]ppp(8) for more info
   on setting up logging levels. Our device gets set with "set device".
   This is the device that the modem is on. In this example the modem is
   on com port 2. Therefore com port 1 would be /dev/cua00. With "set
   speed" we set the speed of our dialup connection and with "set dial"
   we set our dialup parameters. With this we can change our timeout
   time, etc. This line should stay pretty much as it is though.

   Now we can move on and setup our information specific to our ISP. We
   do this by adding another tag under our default: section. This tag can
   be called anything you want, easiest to just use the name of your ISP.
   Here I will use myisp: as our tag refering to our ISP. Here is a
   simple setup incorporating all we need to get ourselves connected.

myisp:
set phone 1234567
set login "ABORT NO\\sCARRIER TIMEOUT 5 ogin:--ogin: ppp word: ppp"
set timeout 120
set ifaddr 10.0.0.1/0 10.0.0.2/0 255.255.255.0 0.0.0.0
add default HISADDR
enable dns

   Here we have setup essential info for that specific ISP. The first
   option "set phone" sets your ISP's dialup number. The "set login" sets
   our login options. Here we have the timeout set to 5, this means that
   we will abort our login attempt after 5 seconds if no carrier.
   Otherwise it will wait for "login:" to be sent and send in your
   username and password. In this example our Username = ppp and Password
   = ppp. These values will need to be changed. The line "set timeout"
   sets the timeout for the entire login process to 120 seconds. The "set
   ifaddr" line is a little tricky. Here is a more extensive
   explaination.
set ifaddr 10.0.0.1/0 10.0.0.2/0 255.255.255.0 0.0.0.0

   In the above line, we have it set in the format of "set ifaddr
   [myaddr[/nn] [hisaddr[/nn] [netmask [triggeraddr]]]]". So the first IP
   specified is what we want as our IP. If you have a static IP address,
   you set it here. In our example we use /0 which says that no bits of
   this ip address need to match and the whole thing can be replaced. The
   second IP specified is what we expect as their IP. If you know this
   you can specify it. Again in our line we don't know what will be
   assigned, so we let them tell us. The third option is our netmask,
   here set to 255.255.255.0.If triggeraddr is specified, it is used in
   place of myaddr in the initial IPCP negotiation. However, only an
   address in the myaddr range will be accepted. This is useful when
   negotiating with some PPP implementations that will not assign an IP
   number unless their peer requests ``0.0.0.0''.

   The next option used "add default HISADDR" sets our default route to
   their IP. This is 'sticky', meaning that if their IP should change,
   our route will automatically be updated. With "enable dns" we are
   telling our ISP to authenticate our nameserver addresses. Do NOT do
   this if you are running an local DNS, as ppp will simply circumvent
   its use by entering some nameserver lines in /etc/resolv.conf.

  Using PPP(8)

   Now that we have our ppp.conf file setup we can start trying to make a
   connection to our ISP. I will detail some commonly used arguments with
   ppp.
     * ppp -auto myisp - This will run ppp, configure your interfaces and
       connect to your isp and then go into the background.
     * ppp -ddial myisp - This is similar to -auto, but if your
       connection is dropped it will try and reconnect.

   By using /usr/sbin/ppp with no options will put you into interactive
   mode. From here you can interact directly with the modem, it is great
   for debugging problems in your ppp.conf file.

  ppp(8) extra's

   In some situations you might want commands executed as your connection
   is made or dropped. There are two files you can create for just these
   situations. /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup and /etc/ppp/ppp.linkdown. Sample
   configurations can be viewed here:
     * [72]ppp.linkup
     * [73]ppp.linkdown

   Extended information can be found at
   [74]http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/userppp.html or
   [75]http://www.freebsd.org/faq/userppp.html.

6.6 - Tuning networking parameters

  6.6.1 - How can I tweak the kernel so that there are a higher number of
  retries and longer timeouts for TCP sessions?

   You would normally use this to allow for routing or connection
   problems. Of course, for it to be most effective, both sides of the
   connection need to use similar values.

   To tweak this, use sysctl and increase the values of:
net.inet.tcp.keepinittime
net.inet.tcp.keepidle
net.inet.tcp.keepintvl

   Using sysctl -a, you can see the current values of these (and many
   other) parameters. To change one, use sysctl -w, as in sysctl -w
   net.inet.tcp.keepidle=28800.

  6.6.2 - How can I turn on directed broadcasts?

   Normally, you don't want to do this. This allows someone to send
   traffic to the broadcast address(es) of your connected network(s) if
   you are using your OpenBSD box as a router.

   There are some instances, in closed networks, where this may be
   useful, particularly when using older implementations of the NetBIOS
   protocol. This is another sysctl. sysctl -w
   net.inet.ip.directed-broadcast=1 turns this on. Read about [76]smurf
   attacks if you want to know why it is off by default.

  6.6.3 - I don't want to the kernel to dynamically allocate a certain port

   There is a sysctl for this also. From [77]sysctl(8):
Set the list of reserved TCP ports that should not be allocated by the
kernel dynamically.  This can be used to keep daemons from stealing a
specific port that another program needs to function.  List elements may
be separated by commas and/or whitespace.

   sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.baddynamic=749,750,751,760,761,871

It is also possible to add or remove ports from the current list.

   sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.baddynamic=+748
   sysctl -w net.inet.tcp.baddynamic=-871

6.7 - Simple NFS usage

   NFS, or Network File System, is used to share a filesystem over the
   network. A few choice man pages to read before trying to setup a NFS
   server are:

     * [78]nfsd(8)
     * [79]mountd(8)
     * [80]exports(5)

   This section will go thru the steps for a simple setup of NFS. This
   example details a server on a LAN, with clients accessing NFS on the
   LAN. It does not talk about securing NFS. We presume you have already
   setup packet filtering or other firewalling protection, to prevent
   outside access. If you are allowing outside access to your NFS server,
   and you have any kind of sensitive data stored on it, we strongly
   recommend that you employ [81]IPSec. Otherwise, people can potentially
   see your NFS traffic. Someone could also pretend to be the IP address
   which you are allowing into your NFS server. There are several attacks
   that can result. When properly configured, IPSec protects against
   these types of attacks.

   Another important security note. Don't just add a filesystem to
   /etc/exports without some kind of list of allowed host(s). Without a
   list of hosts which can mount a particular directory, anyone on who
   can reach your host will be able to mount your NFS exports.

   The setup consists of a server with the ip 10.0.0.1. This server will
   be serving NFS only to clients within that network. The first step to
   setting up NFS is to setup your /etc/exports file. This file lists
   which filesystems you wish to have accessable via NFS and defines who
   is able to access them. There are many options that you can use in
   your /etc/exports file, and it is best that you read the
   [82]exports(5) man page. For this example we have an /etc/exports that
   looks like this:
#
# NFS exports Database
# See exports(5) for more information.  Be very careful, misconfiguration
# of this file can result in your filesystems being readable by the world.
/work -alldirs -ro -network 10.0.0 -mask 255.255.255.0

   This means that the local filesystem /work will be made available via
   NFS. -alldirs specifies that clients will be able to mount at any
   point under the /work mount point. -ro specifies that it will only be
   allowed to be mounted read-only. The last two arguments specify that
   only clients within the 10.0.0.0 network using a netmask of
   255.255.255.0 will be authorized to mount this filesystem. This is
   important for some servers that are accessible by different networks.

   Once your /etc/exports file is setup, you can go ahead and setup your
   NFS server. You should first make sure that options NFSSERVER &
   NFSCLIENT are in your kernel configuration. (GENERIC kernel has these
   options included.) Next, you should set nfs_server=YES in
   /etc/rc.conf. This will bring up both nfsd(8) and mountd(8) when you
   reboot. Now, you can go ahead and start the daemons yourself. These
   daemons need to be started as root, and you need to make sure that
   portmap(8) is running on your system. Here is an example of starting
   nfsd(8) which serves on both TCP and UDP using 4 daemons. You should
   set an appropriate number of NFS server daemons to handle the maximum
   number of concurrent client requests that you want to service.

# /sbin/nfsd -tun 4

   Not only do you have to start the nfsd(8) server, but you need to
   start mountd(8). This is the daemon that actually services the mount
   requests on NFS. To start mountd(8), simply type:

# /sbin/mountd

   If you make changes to /etc/exports while NFS is already running, you
   need to make mountd aware of this! Just HUP it:
# kill -HUP `cat /var/run/mountd.pid`

  Checking Stats on NFS

   From here, you can check to make sure that all these daemons are up
   and registered with RPC. To do this, use rpcinfo(8).

$ rpcinfo -p 10.0.0.1
   program vers proto   port
    100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
    100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
    100005    1   udp    633  mountd
    100005    3   udp    633  mountd
    100005    1   tcp    916  mountd
    100005    3   tcp    916  mountd
    100003    2   udp   2049  nfs
    100003    3   udp   2049  nfs
    100003    2   tcp   2049  nfs
    100003    3   tcp   2049  nfs

   During normal usage, there are a few other utilities that allow you to
   see what is happening with NFS. One is [83]showmount(8) , which allows
   you to view what is currently mounted and who is mounting it. There is
   also nfsstat(8) which shows much more verbose statistics. To use
   showmount(8), try /usr/bin/showmount -a host. For example:

$ /usr/bin/showmount -a 10.0.0.1
All mount points on 10.0.0.1:
10.0.0.37:/work

  Mounting NFS Filesystems

   NFS filesystems should be mounted via mount(8), or more specifically,
   [84]mount_nfs(8). To mount a filesystem /work on host 10.0.0.1 to
   local filesystem /mnt, do this (note that you don't need to use an IP
   address, mount will resolve host names):

# mount -t nfs 10.0.0.1:/work /mnt

   To have your system mount upon boot, add something like this to your
   /etc/fstab:

10.0.0.1:/work /mnt nfs rw 0 0

   It is important that you use 0 0 at the end of this line so that your
   computer does not try to fsck the NFS filesystem on boot!!!! The other
   standard security options, such as noexec, nodev, and nosuid, should
   also be used where applicable. Such as:

10.0.0.1:/work /mnt nfs rw,nodev,nosuid 0 0

   This way, no devices or setuid programs on the NFS server can subvert
   security measures on the NFS client. If you are not mounting programs
   which you expect to run on the NFS client, add noexec to this list.

7.0 - Keyboard Controls

     * [2]7.2 - Is there gpm or the like in OpenBSD?

     * [4]7.4 - Accessing the console scrollback buffer.
     _________________________________________________________________

7.1 - How do I remap the keyboard? (pcvt/i386 specific)

   By using kcon(1), "kcon - keyboard control and remapping for the pcvt
   driver" Before you can use this, you need to turn on character mapping
   with scon.

   Example:
bsd# scon -o
bsd# kcon -m gb

   This will load the keycap file for Great Britain. Note that if you run
   scon -o again, this will turn character mapping back off, which you
   probably don't want to do if you are using kcon for remapping. Keep
   this in mind if you use scon in any automated fashion, such as in
   scripts.

   These commands can only be executed from a pcvt virtual terminal.

7.2 - Is there gpm or the like in OpenBSD?

   Not yet. If you are willing to do a port, contact the [5]ports mailing
   list.

7.3 - Clearing the console each time a user logs out.

   To do this you must add a line in /etc/gettytab. Change the section
   currently:
P|Pc|Pc console:\
        :np:sp#9600:

   Add the line ":cl=\E[H\E[2J:" at the end, so it ends up looking like
   this:
P|Pc|Pc console:\
        :np:sp#9600:\
        :cl=\E[H\E[2J:

7.4 - Accessing the Console Scrollback Buffer (pcvt/i386 specific)

   For OpenBSD 2.6 the ability to scrollback on the console was added for
   i386 machines. This allows you to see information that has already
   scolled past your screen. To be able to move up and down in the buffer
   simply use the key combination "[shift]+[pgup]" to move up, and
   "[shift]+[pgdn]". The default scollback buffer (the amount of pages
   that you can move up and view) is 8, but this can be changed via the
   [6]scon(1) utility. For example, to change the number of pages you can
   scrollback to 10, do this:
bsd$ scon -b 10

   This command can only be executed from a pcvt virtual terminal.

     _________________________________________________________________

8.1 - What are these Kerberos warning when I first login?

   When you first install your system you will most likely notice a
   warning message that is something like this:
   Warning: no Kerberos tickets issued.

   THIS WARNING IS COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT AND SHOULD ONLY BE REMOVED IF
   COMPLETELY NECESSARY

   Well since you probably haven't set up Kerberos on your system, you
   wouldn't be getting a ticket. If you do have Kerberos running, you
   need to check into that. See [15]faq10 Kerberos Setup FAQ. If you
   can't STAND that warning and never plan on using Kerberos here is how
   to get rid of it for good.

     * Make sure you have the source code.
     * Edit /usr/share/mk/bsd.own.mk and set KERBEROS to 'no', or create
       an /etc/mk.conf file that does this.
     * cd /usr/src/usr.bin/login ; make clean ; make ; make install

8.2 - How do I change virtual terminals?

   Simply type [ctrl] - [alt] - [One of the function keys] or just hit
   [f9]-[f12] which are just mapped to [ctrl] - [alt]
   functions. (i386)

   Only the i386 arch has virtual terminal capabilities. You can also use
   virtual terminals when using X. For example, If you start X on term 1,
   and switch with [ctrl]-[alt]-[F2] to term 2, X will seem to disapear
   and will not come back by simply switching back to term 1. You must
   [ctrl]-[alt]-[F5] to get your X display back.

8.3 - I forgot my root password, what do I do now?

   A few steps to recovery
    1. Boot into single user mode. For i386 arch type boot -s at the boot
       prompt.
    2. mount the drives.
        bsd# fsck -p / && mount -u /
    3. If /usr is not the same partition that / is (and it shouldn't be)
       then you will need to mount it, also
        bsd# fsck -p /usr && mount /usr
    4. run [16]passwd(1)
    5. boot into mulituser mode.. and remember your password!

8.4 - X won't start, I get lots of error messages

   If you have X completely set up and you are using an XF86Config that
   you know works then the problem most likely lies in the
   machdep.allowaperture. You also need to make sure that both:
option XSERVER
option APERTURE

   are in your kernel configuration. [BOTH of these are in the GENERIC
   kernel]

   Then you need to edit /etc/sysctl.conf
   and set machdep.allowaperture=1. This will allow X to access the
   aperture driver. This would be set up if the question during install
   about whether or not you would be running X was answered correctly.
   OpenBSD requires for all X servers that the aperture driver be set,
   because it controls access to the I/O ports on video boards.

   For other X problems on the i386, consult the XFree86 FAQ at
   [17]http://www.xfree86.org/FAQ/.

8.5 - What is CVS? and How do I use it?

   CVS is what the OpenBSD project uses to control changes to the source
   code. CVS stands for Concurrent Versions System. You can read more
   about CVS at [18]http://www.cyclic.com/. CVS can be used by the end
   user to keep up to date with source changes, and changes in the ports
   tree. CVS makes it extremely simple to download the source via one of
   the many CVS mirrors for the project.

  How to initially setup your CVS environment

   There are a few ways to initially set up your CVS environment. To
   start off, you will need an initial CVS checkout of the sources. If
   you bought the CD, you're in luck, because it holds the CVS checkout
   for that release. You can extract it from your CD by doing one of the
   following:

   1) copy the tree off it, (assuming the CD is mounted on /mnt):
# mkdir /usr/src
# cd /mnt; cp -Rp CVS Makefile bin distrib etc games gnu \
include kerberosIV lib libexec lkm regress sbin share \
sys usr.bin usr.sbin /usr/src

   2) Or, alternatively, use a union mount with the CD below a writable
   directory. However, be aware that the union filesystem code is not
   flawless.
# mkdir /usr/src
# mount -t union -o -b /mnt /usr/src

   after this, /usr/src will be a nice checkout area where all cvs(1)
   commands will work OK.

   If you don't have an OpenBSD CD, you will have to retrieve the sources
   from on of the OpenBSD AnonCVS servers. These servers are listed on
   [19]http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html Once you have chosen a server
   you need to choose which module you are going to retrieve. There are
   three main modules available for checkout from the CVS tree. These
   are:
     * src - The src module has the complete source code for OpenBSD.
       This includes userland and kernel sources.
     * ports - The ports module holds all you need to have the complete
       OpenBSD ports tree. To read more on the OpenBSD ports tree, read
       [20]Section 8.6 of the OpenBSD FAQ.
     * www - The www module contains all OpenBSD web pages, including
       this FAQ.

   Now that you have decided which module that you wish to retrieve,
   there is one more step left before you can retrieve it. You must
   decide which method to use. CVS by default retrieves files using
   rsh(1), but some AnonCVS servers don't allow for this so in most cases
   it's best to use ssh. For those of you behind a firewall there are
   also the options of pserver and some AnonCVS servers run ssh on port
   2022. Be sure to check [21]http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html for
   which servers support what protocols. Next I will show how to do a
   simple source checkout. Here I will be using an AnonCVS server located
   in the U.S., but remember that if you are outside of the U.S you need
   to use a server that is located nearby. There are many AnonCVS servers
   located throughout the world, so choose one nearest you. I will also
   be using ssh to retrieve the files.
ericj@oshibana:~> export CVS_RSH=/usr/local/bin/ssh
ericj@oshibana:~> echo $CVS_RSH
/usr/local/bin/ssh
ericj@oshibana:~> export CVSROOT=anoncvs@anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org:/cvs
ericj@oshibana:~> cvs get src
Warning: Remote host denied X11 forwarding, perhaps xauth program could not be
run on the server side.
cvs checkout: in directory src:
cvs checkout: cannot open CVS/Entries for reading: No such file or directory
cvs server: Updating src
U src/Makefile
[snip]

   Notice here also that I set the CVSROOT environmental variable. This
   is the variable that tells cvs(1) which AnonCVS server to use. This
   can also be specified using the -d option. For example:
ericj@oshibana:~>cvs -d anoncvs@anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org:/cvs get src

   These commands should be run in /usr, which will then create the
   directories of /usr/src, /usr/ports, and /usr/www. Depending, of
   course, on which module you checkout. You can download these modules
   to anywhere, but if you wanted to do work with them (ie make build ),
   it is expected that they be at the place above.

  Keeping your CVS tree up-to-date

   Once you have your initial tree setup, keeping it up-to-date is the
   easy part. You can update your tree at any time you choose, some
   AnonCVS servers update more often then others, so again check
   [22]http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html. In this example I will be
   updating my www module from anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org. Notice the -q
   option that I use, this makes the output not so verbose coming from
   the server.
ericj@oshibana:~> echo $CVSROOT
anoncvs@anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org:/cvs
ericj@oshibana:~> cvs -q up -PAd www
Warning: Remote host denied X11 forwarding, perhaps xauth program could not be
run on the server side.
U www/want.html
M www/faq/faq8.html
ericj@oshibana:~>

  Other cvs options

   For some, bandwidth and time are serious problems when updating
   repositories such as these. So CVS has a -z[1-9] option which uses
   gzip to compress the data. To use it, do -z[compression-level], for
   instance, -z3 for a compression level of 3.

8.6 - What is the ports tree?

   The ports tree is a set of Makefiles that download, patch, configure
   and install userland programs so you can run them in OpenBSD
   environment without having to do all that by hand. You can get the
   ports tree from any of the OpenBSD ftp servers in
   /pub/OpenBSD/2.6/ports.tar.gz. The most recent ports are available via
   the 'ports' cvs tree, or /pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/ports.tar.gz. For most
   of you however, packages will be a much better option. Packages are
   created from ports and are already compiled and ready to use. To read
   more on packages read [23]FAQ8.7.

  Obtaining the Latest Version of the Ports Tree

   If you are planning on running the latest version of the Ports Tree,
   you should have the latest release of OpenBSD. This is because of
   constant changing and fixing of the ports tree to help with its
   interaction with the rest of your OpenBSD system. If you don't follow
   this guideline, you can expect some minor problems while upgrading.

   The best way to stay current with your OpenBSD Ports Tree is to use
   via cvs(1). OpenBSD has a whole group of Anonymous CVS servers that
   are available to anyone. To read more about cvs look over
   [24]www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html and [25]Faq8.5.

   Though, if you do not have the ports tree at all, you can download it
   via any of OpenBSD's ftp servers. You can get a list at
   [26]www.openbsd.org/ftp.html. From here download
   /pub/OpenBSD/2.5/ports.tar.gz and untar this in /usr/ports. For
   example:
ericj@oshibana> ftp ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.5/ports.tar.gz
ericj@oshibana> sudo cp ports.tar.gz /usr
ericj@oshibana> cd /usr; sudo tar xfz ports.tar.gz

   Once this is done, you can use cvs(1) to update your Ports Tree. If
   you started with a base Ports Tree of 2.5 there will be a few changes
   that you will need to make. Most notably /usr/share/mk, which holds
   files used by make(1), will need to be updated. If you have the src
   tree on your system, you can update /usr/share/mk via cvs(1) and
   simply:
ericj@oshibana> cd /usr/src/share/mk; sudo make install

   This will put the proper files into place. After this is done, you
   might also need the latest version of the make(1) binary. You will
   have to create this, if you don't have the src tree on your system you
   can grab it via cvs(1) and compile it. Example:
ericj@oshibana> export CVS_RSH=/usr/bin/ssh
ericj@oshibana> cvs -danoncvs@any.anoncvs.server:/cvs get src/usr.bin/make
cvs server: Updating src/usr.bin/make
U src/usr.bin/make/Makefile
U src/usr.bin/make/Makefile.boot
U src/usr.bin/make/arch.c
U src/usr.bin/make/bit.h
U src/usr.bin/make/buf.c
U src/usr.bin/make/buf.h
U src/usr.bin/make/compat.c
[SNIP]
ericj@oshibana> cd src/usr.bin/make; sudo make install

   If you already have the src on your machine, simply update make and
   install it. For now, this should be all you need to do to have the
   ports tree working properly.

   A snapshot of the ports tree is also created daily and can be
   downloaded from any of the [27]OpenBSD ftp servers as
   /pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/ports.tar.gz.

  What ports are available? and how do i find them?

   There are two ways of searching for ports. The first way is to check
   [28]www.openbsd.org/portstat.html. There you will find a list of what
   ports are currently available. The other way is to actually use the
   ports tree to search for keywords. To do this use make search
   key="searchkey". Here is an example of a search for 'samba':
ericj@oshibana> make search key="samba"
Port:   samba-2.0.5a

Maint:  dugsong@monkey.org

Archs:  any

  Installing Ports

   Ports are set up to be EXTREMELY easy to make and install. Here is an
   example install for someone wanting to install the X11 program xfig.
   You'll notice the dependencies are automatically detected and
   completed:

   First you need to cd to the dir of the program you want. If you are
   searching for a program, you can either update your locate database,
   or use the search function talked about below. Once you are in the dir
   of the program you want, you can just type make install. For example.

  Other Information

   More information about the ports can be found in the [29]ports(7) man
   page.

   Our ports tree is constantly being expanded, and if you would like to
   help please see: [30]http://www.openbsd.org/ports.html

8.7 - What are packages?

   Packages are the precompiled binaries of some of the most used
   programs. They are ready for use on an OpenBSD system. Again, like the
   ports, packages are very easy to maintain and update. Packages are
   constantly being added so be sure to check each release for additional
   packages.

   Here is a list of tools used in managing packages.
     * [31]pkg_add(1) - a utility for installing software package
       distributions
     * [32]pkg_create(1) - a utility for creating software package
       distributions
     * [33]pkg_delete(1) - a utility for deleting previously installed
       software package distributions
     * [34]pkg_info(1) - a utility for displaying information on software
       packages

  Where to find packages

   If you are a smart user and bought one of the [35]OpenBSD CD, then
   packages can be found on both CD's depending on your architecture. If
   you don't have an OpenBSD CD in your posession you can download
   packages from any of the ftp mirrors. You can get a list of mirrors
   [36]http://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html. Packages are located at
   /pub/OpenBSD/2.6/packages from there packages are broken down
   depending on architecture.

  Installing Packages

   To install packages, the utility [37]pkg_add(1) is used. pkg_add(1) is
   an extremely easy utility to use, in the following two examples
   pkg_add(1) will be used to install a package. The first example will
   show pkg_add(1) installing a package that resides on a local disk, the
   second example will show an installation of a package via ftp. In both
   examples screen-3.7.6 will be installed.

Attempting to record package into `/var/db/pkg/screen
Package `screen-3.7.6' registered in `/var/db/pkg/screen-3.7.6'

   In this example the -v flag was used to give a more verbose output,
   this option is not needed, but is helpful for debugging and was used
   here to give a little more insight into what pkg_add(1) is actually
   doing. Notice however, that there are some valid messages given out
   mentioning /etc/screenrc. Messages like this will be given to you
   whether or not you use the -v flag.
   Installing via ftp
$ sudo pkg_add ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.6/packages/i386/screen-3.7.6

   In this example you can see that I installed the i386 package, you
   should substitute this with your architecture. Notice: Not all
   architectures have the same packages. Some ports don't work on certain
   architectures. In this example the -v flag wasn't used, so only NEEDED
   messages are shown.

  Viewing and Deleting Installed Packages

   The utility [38]pkg_info(1) is used to view a list of packages that
   are already installed on your system. This is usually needed to find
   out the correct name of a package before you remove that package. To
   see what packages are installed on your system simple use:
$ pkg_info
sslUSA26           ssl26.1 USA-only non-commercial crypto libs incl. SSL & RSA
mpg123-0.59q       mpeg audio 1/2 layer 1, 2 and 3 player
nmap-2.3b6         port scanning large networks
ircii-2.8.2-epic3.004enhanced version of ircII (internet relay chat)
screen-3.7.6       multi-screen window manager
unzip-5.40         extract, list & test files in a ZIP archive
xntp3-5.93e-export Network Time Protocol implementation
icb-5.0.9          Internet CB - mostly-defunct chat client

   To delete a package, simple take the proper name of the package as
   shown by pkg_info(1) and use [39]pkg_delete(1) to remove the package.
   In the below example, the screen package is being removed. Notice that
   on some occations there are instructions of extra objects that need to
   be removed that pkg_delete(1) did not remove for you. As with the
   pkg_add(1) utility, you can use the -v flag to get more verbose
   output.
$ sudo pkg_delete screen-3.7.6

+---------------
| To completely deinstall the screen-3.7.6 package you need to perform
| this step as root:
|
|           rm -f /etc/screenrc
|
| Do not do this if you plan on re-installing screen-3.7.6
| at some future time.
+---------------

8.8 - Is there any way to use my floppy drive if it's not attached during boot?

   Sure. You need to add "flags 0x20" at the end of the fd* entry and
   recompile your kernel. The line should be read:
  fd*     at fdc? drive ? flags 0x20

   After that you would be able to use the floppy drive all the times. It
   doesn't matter if you plugged it in after boot.

8.9 - Boot time Options - Using the OpenBSD bootloader

   When booting your OpenBSD system, you have probably noticed the boot
   prompt.

   boot>

   For most people, you won't have to do anything here. It will
   automatically boot if no commands are given. But sometimes problems
   arise, or special functions are needed. That's where these options
   will come in handy. To start off, you should read through the
   [40]boot(8) man page. Here we will go over the most common used
   commands for the bootloader.

   To start off, if no commands are issued, the bootloader will
   automatically try to boot /bsd. If that fails it will try /obsd, and
   so on till it finds a bootable kernel. You can specify this by hand by
   typing:
   boot> boot wd0a:/bsd

   or
   boot> b /bsd

   This will work if device wd0a is configured as your root device.

   Here is a brief list of options you can use with the OpenBSD kernel.
     * -a : This will allow you to specify an alternate root device after
       booting the kernel.
     * -c : This allows you to enter the boot time configuration. Check
       the [41]Boot Time Config section of the faq.
     * -s : This is the option to boot into single user mode.
     * -d : This option is used to dump the kernel into ddb. Keep in mind
       that you must have DDB built into the kernel.
     * -b : Shortcut for RB_HALT.

   These are entered in the format of: boot [ image [-abcds]]

   For further reading you can read [42]boot_i386(8) man page

8.10 - S/Key

   S/Key is a ``one-time password'' scheme. This allows for one-time
   passwords for use on un-secured channels. This can come very handy for
   those who don't have the ability to use ssh or any other encrypted
   channels. OpenBSD's S/Key implementation can use a variety of
   algorithms as the one-way hash. Here is the list of algorithms
   available:
     * [43]md4
     * [44]md5
     * [45]sha1
     * [46]rmd160.

  Setting up S/Key - The first steps

   To start off the file /etc/skeykeys must exist. If this file is not in
   existence, have the super-user create it. This can be done simply by
   doing:
# touch /etc/skeykeys

   Once that file is in existence, you can initalize your S/Key. To do
   this you will have to use [47]skeyinit(1). With skeyinit(1), you will
   first be prompted for your password to the system. This is the same
   password that you used to log into the system. Running skeyinit(1)
   over an insecure channel is completely not recommended, so this should
   be done over a secure channel (such as ssh) or the console. Once you
   have authorized yourself with your system password you will be asked
   for yet another password. This password is the secret password, and is
   NOT your system password. The secret password is not limited to 8
   characters like system passwords, actually it must be at least 10
   characters. A few word phrases are suggested. Here is an example user
   being added.
oshibana:ericj> skeyinit ericj
[Adding ericj]
Reminder - Only use this method if you are directly connected
           or have an encrypted channel.  If you are using telnet
           or rlogin, exit with no password and use skeyinit -s.
Enter secret password:
Again secret password:

ID ericj skey is otp-md5 99 oshi45820
Next login password: HAUL BUS JAKE DING HOT HOG

   One line of particular importance in here is ID ericj skey is otp-md5
   99 oshi45820. This gives a lot of information to the user. Here is a
   breakdown of the sections and their importance.
     * otp-md5 - This shows which one-way was used to create your
       One-Time Password (otp).
     * 99 - This is your sequence number. This is a number from 100 down
       to 1. Once it reaches one, another secret password must be
       created.
     * oshi45820 - This is your key.

   But of more immediate importance is your password. Your password
   consists of 6 small words, combined together this is your password,
   spaces and all.

  Actually using S/Key to login.

   By now your skey has been initialized, and you have your password.
   You're ready to login. Here is an example session using s/key to
   login.
oshibana:ericj> ftp localhost
Connected to localhost.
220 oshibana.shin.ms FTP server (Version 6.4/OpenBSD) ready.

   Some of you might have noticed that my sequence number has changed.
   otp-md5 96 oshi45820. This is because by now I have used s/key to
   login several times. But how do you get your password after you've
   logged in once? Well to do this, you'll need to know what sequence
   number you're using and your key. As you're probably thinking, how can
   you remember which sequence number you're on? Well this is simple, use
   [48]skeyinfo(1), and it will tell you what to use. For example here, I
   need to generate another password for a login that I might have to
   make in the future. (remember I'm doing this from a secure channel).
oshibana:ericj> skeyinfo
95 oshi45820

   From this I can create the password for my next login. To do so, I'll
   use [49]skey(1). I can use exactly that output from above to create my
   password.
oshibana:ericj> skey 95 oshi45820
Reminder - Do not use this program while logged in via telnet or rlogin.
Enter secret password:
NOOK CHUB HOYT SAC DOLE FUME

   I'm sure many of you won't always have a secure connect to create
   these passwords, and creating them over an insecure connection isn't
   feasible, so how can you create multiple passwords at one time? Well
   you can supply skey(1) with a number of how many passwords you want
   created. This can then be printed out and taken with you wherever you
   go.
oshibana:ericj> skey -n 5 95 oshi45820
Reminder - Do not use this program while logged in via telnet or rlogin.
Enter secret password:
91: SHIM SET LEST HANS SMUG BOOT
92: SUE ARTY YAW SEED KURD BAND
93: JOEY SOOT PHI KYLE CURT REEK
94: WIRE BOGY MESS JUDE RUNT ADD
95: NOOK CHUB HOYT SAC DOLE FUME

   Notice here though, that the bottom password should be the first used,
   because we are counting down from 100.

    Using S/Key with telnet(1), ssh(1), and rlogin(1)

   Using S/Key with telnet(1), ssh(1), or rlogin(1) is done in pretty
   much the same fashion as with ftp, only your first password must be
   "s/key". Example:
ericj@oshibana> telnet localhost
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.

Welcome to OpenBSD: The proactively secure Unix-like operating system.

Please use the sendbug(1) utility to report bugs in the system.
Before reporting a bug, please try to reproduce it with the latest
version of the code.  With bug reports, please try to ensure that
enough information to reproduce the problem is enclosed, and if a
known fix for it exists, include that as well.

You have mail.

  Controlling S/Key

   For more control over S/Key there is the /etc/skey.access file. (This
   does not exist by default, so it must be created.) This file can
   restrict S/Key in three primary ways.
     * permit internet - Which will allow certain IPs to connect and use
       s/key.
     * permit user - Which will allow users by login name access to s/key
       use.
     * permit port - Which is really only useful for assigned ports, (ie
       dial-up)

   If I wanted to allow one single user ( ericj ), from a certain IP (
   10.1.1.5 ), I would create a file like so.
# cat /etc/skey.access
permit internet 10.1.1.5
permit user ericj

8.11 - Why is my Macintosh losing so much time?

   This is caused by a hardware bug. OpenBSD uses clock interrupts to
   keep track of the current time, but these interrupts have the lowest
   priority in Apple's architecture. So, under heavy load, (such as disk
   or network activity) clock interrupts will be lost and the Unix clock
   will not advance as it should.

   MacOS gets around the time problem by always reading the hardware
   clock. OpenBSD only reads the hardware clock at boot time and
   thereafter ignores it. You may notice that, at shutdown, the kernel is
   not confident enough to write the Unix time back into the hardware
   clock because this time loss problem is well known.

   The best solution is to run xntpd (found in the ports collection) and
   just deal with the occasional lossage. Sometimes the lossage is so bad
   that even xntpd is afraid to skip the time. In this case, add the -g
   option to ntpd in /etc/rc.securelevel to force tracking.

   Another simpler but less precise solution is to run rdate(8) on a
   regular basis, for example by having a crontab entry for it,
   preferably with the -a option so there is no "jump" in time. Another
   good place to launch rdate(8) is in your /etc/ppp/ppp.linkup file if
   you are not permanently connected and are a PPP user.

   See also:
   [50]http://www.macbsd.com/macbsd/macbsd-docs/faq/faq-3.html#ss3.17

8.12 - Will OpenBSD run on multiprocessor machines?

   No. OpenBSD/i386 will not make use of multiple processors, but will
   run using one processor on a multi-processor system board.
   OpenBSD/sparc will not run on a multi-processor sparc system at all.
   No other platforms currently support multi-processor capabilities.

   The reason is quite simple: there are not enough developers who have
   access to MP machines. If you want to donate MP hardware, please refer
   to [51]http://www.openbsd.org/donations.html. Our developers are
   currently asking for i386, sparc, hppa, and other multi-processor
   hardware donations to begin SMP support.

8.13 - I get Input/output error when trying to use my tty devices

   As of OpenBSD 2.6, you need to use /dev/cuaXX for connections
   initiated from the OpenBSD system, the /dev/ttyXX devices are intended
   only for terminal or dial-in usage. While it was possible to use the
   tty devices in the past, the OpenBSD kernel is no longer compatible
   with this usage.

   From cua(4):

   For hardware terminal ports, dial-out is supported through matching
   device nodes called calling units. For instance, the terminal called
   /dev/tty03 would have a matching calling unit called /dev/cua03. These
   two devices are normally differentiated by creating the calling unit
   device node with a minor number 128 greater than the dial-in device
   node. Whereas the dial-in device (the tty) normally requires a
   hardware signal to indicate to the system that it is active, the
   dial-out device (the cua) does not, and hence can communicate
   unimpeded with a device such as a modem. This means that a process
   like [52]getty(8) will wait on a dial-in device until a connection is
   established. Meanwhile, a dial-out connection can be established on
   the dial-out device (for the very same hardware terminal port) without
   disturbing anything else on the system. The [53]getty(8) process does
   not even notice that anything is happening on the terminal port. If a
   connecting call comes in after the dial-out connection has finished,
   the [54]getty(8) process will deal with it properly, without having
   noticed the intervening dial-out action.

8.14 - Where can I find a Netscape binary for OpenBSD?

   There is no OpenBSD Netscape binary. However since OpenBSD supports
   binary emulation of many other operating systems we are able to use
   other binaries.
     * For I386 systems, it is best to use the BSDI binary.
     * For SPARC systems, it is best to use the SUN-OS binary.

   Using the [55]Ports System you can install these with no hassle. The
   Navigator Port is located at /usr/ports/www/navigator and the
   Communicator port is located at /usr/ports/www/communicator. Once you
   have the ports tree installed.

9.1 - Simple tips for Linux (and other free Unix-like OS) users

   There are several differences between OpenBSD and Linux. These
   differences include but are not limited to, bootup procedure, network
   interface usage and disk management. Most differences are well
   documented, but involve searching manpages. This document tries to be
   an index of those differences.

     * OpenBSD has a ports tree. This is to accomodate the fact that at
       this point not many applications are native to the OpenBSD
       environment. This is both an attempt to get applications to work
       on OpenBSD for end-users and to get more applications made with
       OpenBSD in mind. Eventually this ports tree will be used to make a
       nice set of binary packages.
     * OpenBSD uses CVS for source changes. With Linux, source code is
       disseminated through separate distributions. OpenBSD has pioneered
       anonymous CVS, which allows anyone to extract the full source tree
       for any version of OpenBSD (from 2.0 to current, and all revisions
       of all files in between) at any time! There is also a very
       convenient and easy to use [5]web interface to CVS.
     * OpenBSD periodically releases snapshots for various architectures
       and makes a stable, official CD release every 6 months.
     * OpenBSD contains STRONG CRYPTO, which USA based OS's can't
       contain. (See [6]http://www.openbsd.org/crypto.html) OpenBSD has
       also gone through heavy security auditing and many security
       features have already been implemented into the source tree.
       (IPSEC, KERBEROS).
     * OpenBSD's kernel is /bsd.
     * The names of hard disks are usually /dev/wd and /dev/sd (ATA/SCSI)
     * /sbin/ifconfig with no arguments in Linux gives the state of all
       the interfaces. Under OpenBSD you need the -a flag.
     * /sbin/route with no arguments in Linux gives the state of all the
       active routes. Under OpenBSD you need the "show" parameter, or do
       a netstat -r (nice).
     * OpenBSD comes with Darren Reed's IP Filter package, not ipfw. This
       means that:
          + IP-Masquerading is done through ipnat. ([7]ipnat(1))
          + ipfwadm is done through ipf ([8]ipf(1), [9]ipf(5))
          + You should look at [10]section 6 for detailed configuration
            assistance and information.
     * Interface address is stored in /etc/hostname.<interfacename>. It
       can be a name instead of an IP address.
     * The machine name is in /etc/myname
     * The default gateway is in /etc/mygate
     * The network interface aliases are in /etc/ifaliases
     * OpenBSD's default shell is /bin/sh, which is the Korn shell.
       Shells such as bash and tcsh can be added as packages or installed
       from the ports tree.
     * Password management changes a lot. The main files are different.
       ([11]passwd(1), [12]passwd(5))
     * Devices are named by driver, not by type. So for example, there
       are no eth* devices. It would be ne0 for an ne2000 ethernet card,
       and xl0 for a 3Com Etherlink XL and Fast Etherlink XL ethernet
       device, etc.
     * OpenBSD developers have made serious efforts to keep the manual
       pages up-to-date and accurate. Use the [13]man(1) command to find
       information.

9.2 - Dual booting Linux and OpenBSD

   Yes! it is possible!

   Read [14]INSTALL.linux

9.3 - Converting your Linux (or other System 7-style) password file to
BSD-style

   First, figure out if your Linux password file is shadowed or not. If
   it is, grab [15]John the Ripper and use the unshadow utility that
   comes with it to merge your passwd and shadow files into one System
   7-style file.

   Using your Linux password file, we'll call it linux_passwd, you need
   to add in ::0:0 between fields four and seven. Awk does this for you.
# cat linux_passwd | awk -F : '{printf("%s:%s:%s:%s::0:0:%s:%s:%s\n",$1,$2,$3,$
4,$5,$6,$7); }' > new_passwd

   At this point, you want to edit the new_passwd file and remove the
   root and other system entries that are already present in your OpenBSD
   password file or aren't applicable with OpenBSD (all of them). Also,
   make sure there are no duplicate usernames or user IDs between
   new_passwd and your OpenBSD box's /etc/passwd. The easiest way to do
   this is to start with a fresh /etc/passwd.
# cat new_passwd >> /etc/master.passwd
# pwd_mkdb -p /etc/master.passwd

   The last step, pwd_mkdb is necessary to rebuild the /etc/spwd.db and
   /etc/pwd.db files. It also creates a System 7-style password file
   (minus encrypted passwords) at /etc/passwd for programs which use it.
   OpenBSD uses a stronger encryption for passwords, blowfish, which is
   very unlikely to be found on any system which uses full System 7-style
   password files. To switch over to this stronger encryption, simply
   have the users run 'passwd' and change their password. The new
   password they enter will be encrypted with your default setting
   (usually blowfish unless you've edited /etc/passwd.conf). Or, as root,
   you can run passwd username.

9.4 - Getting OpenBSD and Linux to interact

   If you are migrating from Linux to OpenBSD, note that OpenBSD has
   COMPAT_LINUX enabled by default in the GENERIC kernel. To run any
   Linux binaries that are not statically linked (most of them), you need
   to follow the instructions on the [16]compat_linux(8) manual page. A
   simple way to get most of the useful Linux libraries is to install
   linux_lib from your ports collection. To find out more about the Ports
   collection read [17]FAQ 8.6. If you already have the ports tree
   installed use these commands to get linux libraries installed.
# cd /usr/ports/emulators/linux_lib
# make install

   OpenBSD supports the EXT2FS file system. Use disklabel disk (where
   disk is the device name for your disk. ) to see what OpenBSD thinks
   your Linux partition is (but don't use disklabel or fdisk to make any
   changes to it). For further information on using disklabel read
   [18]FAQ 14.1.

     _________________________________________________________________

10.1 - Why does it say that I'm in the wrong group when I try to su root?

   Existing users must be added to the "wheel" group by hand. This is
   done for security reasons, and you should be cautious with whom you
   give access to. On OpenBSD, users who are in the wheel group are
   allowed to use the [14]su(1) userland program to become root. Users
   who are not in "wheel" cannot use su(1). Here is an example of a
   /etc/group entry to place the user ericj into the "wheel" group.

   If you are adding a new user with [15]adduser(8), you can put them in
   the wheel group by answering wheel at Invite user into other groups:
   This will add them to /etc/group, which will look something like this:
wheel:*:0:root,ericj

   If you are looking for a way to allow users limited access to
   superuser privileges, without putting them in the "wheel" group, use
   [16]sudo(8).

10.2 - How do I duplicate a filesystem?

   To duplicate your filesystem use [17]dump(8) and [18]restore(8). For
   example. To duplicate everything under directory SRC to directory DST,
   do a:
# cd /SRC; dump 0f - . | (cd /DST; restore -rf - )

   dump is designed to give you plenty of backup capabilities, and it may
   be an overkill if you just want to duplicate a part of a (or an
   entire) filesystem. The command [19]tar(1) may be faster for this
   operation. The format looks very similar:
# cd /SRC; tar cf -  . | (cd /DST; tar xpf - )

10.3 - How do I start daemons with the system? ( Overview of rc(8) )

   OpenBSD uses an [20]rc(8) style startup. This uses a few key files for
   startup.
     * /etc/rc - Main script. Should not be edited.
     * /etc/rc.conf - Configuration file used by /etc/rc to know what
       daemons should start with the system.
     * /etc/netstart - Script used to initialize the network. Shouldn't
       be edited.
     * /etc/rc.local - Script used for local administration. This is
       where new daemons or host specific information should be stored.
     * /etc/rc.securelevel - Script which runs commands that must be run
       before the security level changes. See [21]init(8)
     * /etc/rc.shutdown - Script run on shutdown. Put anything you want
       done before shutdown in this file. See [22]rc.shutdown(8)

  How does rc(8) work?

   The main files a system administrator should concentrate on are
   /etc/rc.conf, /etc/rc.local and /etc/rc.shutdown. To get a look of how
   the rc(8) procedure works, here is a the flow:
   After the kernel is booted. /etc/rc is started.
     * Filesystems checked. This will always be bypassed if the file
       /etc/fastboot exists. This is certainly not a good idea though.
     * Configuration Variables are read in from /etc/rc.conf
     * Filesystems are mounted
     * Clears out /tmp and preserves any editor files
     * Configures the network via /etc/netstart
          + Configures your interfaces up.
          + Sets your hostname, domainname, etc.
     * Starts system daemons
     * Does various checks. (quota's, savecore, etc)
     * Local daemons are run, ala /etc/rc.local

  Starting Daemons and Services that come with OpenBSD

   Most daemons and services that come with OpenBSD by default can be
   started on boot by simply editing the /etc/rc.conf configuration file.
   To start out take a look at the default [23]/etc/rc.conf file. You'll
   see lines similar to this:
ftpd_flags=NO           # for non-inetd use: ftpd_flags="-D"

   A line like this shows that ftpd is not starting up with the system. (
   At least not via rc(8), read the [24]Anonymous FTP FAQ to read more
   about this. ) In any case, each line also has a comment showing you
   the flags for NORMAL usage of that daemon or service. This doesn't
   mean that you must run that daemon or service with those flags. You
   can always use man(1) to see how you can have that daemon or service
   start up in any way you like. For example, Here is the default line
   pertaining to httpd(8).
httpd_flags=NO          # for normal use: "" (or "-DSSL" after reading ssl(8))

   Here you can obviously see that starting up httpd normally no flags
   are necessary. So a line like: " httpd_flags=""" would be necessary.
   But to start httpd with ssl enabled. (Refer to the [25]SSL FAQ or
   [26]ssl(8)) You should start with a line like: "httpd_flags="-DSSL"".

  Starting up local daemons and configuration

   For other daemons that you might install with the system via ports or
   other ways, you will use the /etc/rc.local file. For example, I've
   installed a daemon in which lie's at /usr/local/sbin/daemonx. I want
   this to start at boot time. I would put an entry into /etc/rc.local
   like this:
if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/daemonx ]; then
             echo -n ' daemonx';       /usr/local/sbin/daemonx
fi

   From now on, this daemon will be run at boot. You will be able to see
   any errors on boot, a normal boot with no errors would show a line
   like this:
Starting local daemons: daemonx.

  rc.shutdown

   /etc/rc.shutdown is a script that is run a shutdown. Anything you want
   done before the system shuts down should be added to this file. If you
   have apm, you can also set "powerdown=YES". Which will give you the
   equivlent of "shutdown -p".

10.4 - Why do users get relaying access denied when they are remotely sending
mail through my OpenBSD system?

   Try this:
# cat /etc/sendmail.cf | grep relay-domains

   The output may look something like this:
FR-o /etc/mail/relay-domains

   If this file doesn't exist, create it. You will need to enter the
   hosts who are sending mail remotely with the following syntax:
.domain.com    #Allow relaying for/to any host in domain.com
sub.domain.com #Allow relaying for/to sub.domain.com and any host in that domai
n
10.2           #Allow relaying from all hosts in the IP net 10.2.*.*

   Don't forget send a 'HangUP' signal to sendmail, (a signal which
   causes most daemons to re-read their configration file):
# kill -HUP `cat /var/run/sendmail.pid`

10.5 - I've set up POP, but users have trouble accessing mail thru POP. What
can I do?

   Most issues dealing with POP are problems with temporary files and
   lock files. If your pop server sends an error message such as:
-ERR Couldn't open temporary file, do you own it?

   Try setting up your permissions as such:
permission in  /var
drwxrwxr-x   2 bin     mail     512 May 26 20:08 mail


permissions in  /var/mail
-rw-------   1 username   username        0 May 26 20:08 username

   Another thing to check is that the user actually owns their own
   /var/mail file. Of course this should be the case (as in,
   /var/mail/joe should be owned by joe) but if it isn't set correctly it
   could be the problem!

   Of course, making /var/mail writeable by group mail opens up some
   vague and obscure security problems. It is likely that you will never
   have problems with it. But it could (especially if you are a high
   profile site, ISP,...)! Try running cucipop or another POP daemon from
   the OpenBSD ports collection. Or, you could just have the wrong
   options selected for your pop daemon (like dot locking). Or, you may
   just need to change the directory that it locks in (although then the
   locking would only be valueable for the POP daemon.)

10.6 - Setting up a Secure HTTP server with SSL(8)

   Starting with OpenBSD 2.6, OpenBSD ships with an SSL-ready httpd.
   However, because of various patents, some libaries cannot be shipped.
   So, to be able to use RSA certificates you must install extra
   libraries onto your system. There are two sets of these libraries,
   depending on your location in the world. (NOTE: Those who did an FTP
   install, or any network install most likely have already installed
   this onto your system). For people living outside of the United
   States, you should use a package called "ssl26.tgz", Those living in
   the United States must use "sslUSA26.tgz". These are packages,
   therefore installed using the [30]pkg_add(1) utility. For example, To
   install the NON-U.S. Resident version of the libraries use the
   following line where ${arch} is your architecture. (NOTE:: This is not
   available for the Alpha architecture due to its lack of shared libs.)

# pkg_add ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.6/packages/${arch}/ssl26.tgz

   For use with [31]httpd(8), you must first have a certificate created.
   This will be kept in /etc/ssl/private/. The steps shown here are taken
   in part from the [32]ssl(8) man page. Refer to it for further
   information. This FAQ entry only outlines how to create an RSA
   certificate for web servers, not a DSA server certificate. To find out
   how to do so, please refer to the [33]ssl(8) man page.

   To start off, you need to create your server key and certificate. To
   use the RSA features, you must have upgraded your libssl. Now you can
   create your key. Using OpenSSL:

# openssl genrsa -out /etc/ssl/private/server.key 1024

   Or, if you wish the key to be encrypted with a passphrase that you
   will have to type in when starting servers

# openssl genrsa -des3 -out /etc/ssl/private/server.key 1024

   The next step is to generate a Certificate Signing Request which is
   used to get a Certifying Authority (CA) to sign your certificate. To
   do this use the command:

# openssl req -new -key /etc/ssl/private/server.key -out /etc/ssl/private/serve
r.csr

   This server.csr file can then be given to Certifying Authority who
   will sign the key. One such CA is Thawte Certification which you can
   reach at [34]http://www.thawte.com/. Thawte can currently sign RSA
   keys for you. A procedure is being worked out to allow for DSA keys.

   If you cannot afford this, or just want to sign the certificate
   yourself, you can use the following.

# openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in /etc/ssl/private/server.csr \
       -signkey /etc/ssl/private/server.key -out /etc/ssl/server.crt

   With /etc/ssl/server.crt and /etc/ssl/private/server.key in place, you
   should be able to start [35]httpd(8) with the -DSSL

10.7 - I edited /etc/passwd, but the changes didn't seem to take place. Why?

   If you edit /etc/passwd, your changes will be lost. OpenBSD generates
   /etc/passwd dynamically with [36]pwd_mkdb(8). The main password file
   in OpenBSD is /etc/master.passwd. According to pwd_mkdb(8),
FILES
     /etc/master.passwd  current password file
     /etc/passwd         a Version 7 format password file
     /etc/pwd.db         insecure password database file
     /etc/pwd.db.tmp     temporary file
     /etc/spwd.db        secure password database file
     /etc/spwd.db.tmp    temporary file

   In a traditional Unix password file, such as /etc/passwd, everything
   including the user's encrypted password is available to anyone on the
   system (and is a prime target for programs such as Crack.) 4.4BSD
   introduces the master.passwd file, which has an extended format (with
   additional options beyond what was provided by /etc/passwd) and is
   only readable by root. For faster access to data, the library calls
   which access this data normally read /etc/pwd.db and /etc/spwd.db.

   OpenBSD does come with a tool with which you should edit your password
   file. It is called vipw(8). Vipw will use vi (or your favourite editor
   defined per $EDITOR) to edit /etc/master.passwd. After you are done
   editing, it will re-create /etc/passwd, /etc/pwd.db, and /etc/spwd.db
   as per your changes. Vipw also takes care of locking these files, so
   that if anyone else attempts to change them at the same time, they
   will be denied access.

10.8 - What is the best way to add and delete users?

   The best way to add a user in OpenBSD is to use the [37]adduser(8)
   script. You can configure this to work however you like by editing
   /etc/adduser.conf. You can add users by hand, but this is the
   recommended way to add users. adduser(8) allows for consistency checks
   on /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and shell databases. It will create the
   entries and HOME directories for you. It can even send a message to
   the user welcoming them. This can be changed to meet your needs. For
   further instructions on adding users read the [38]adduser_proc(8) man
   page.

   To delete users you should use the [39]rmuser(8) utility. This will
   remove all existence of a user. It will remove any crontab(1) entries,
   their HOME dir (if it is owned by the user), and their mail. Of course
   it will also remove their /etc/passwd and /etc/group entries.

10.9 - How do I create an ftp-only account (not anonymous FTP!)?

   There are a few ways to do this, but a very common way to do such is
   to add /bin/false into /etc/shells. Then when you create the user set
   his shell to /bin/false, they will not be able log in interactively,
   but will be able to use ftp capabilities. adduser(8) will give them a
   home dir by default of /home/. If this is what you desire it doesn't
   need to be changed, however you can set this to whatever directory you
   wish. You can force this user to only be able to see files in their
   home directory by adding their username to /etc/ftpchroot. Using the
   -A option to ftpd, you can allow only ftpchroot logins!

10.10 - Setting up Quotas

   Quotas are used to limit users space that they have available to them
   on your drives. It can be very helpful in situations where you have
   limited resources. Quotas can be set in two different ways.

     * User Quotas
     * Group Quotas

   The first step to setting up quotas is to make sure that option QUOTA
   is in your Kernel Configuration. This option is in the GENERIC kernel.
   After this you need to mark in /etc/fstab the filesystems which will
   have quotas enabled. The keywords userquota and groupquota should be
   used to mark each fs that you will be using quotas on. By default the
   files quota.user and quota.group will be created at the root of that
   filesystem to hold the quota information. This default can be
   overwritten by doing, userquota=/var/quotas/quota.user. Or whatever
   file you want to use for holding quota information. Here is an example
   /etc/fstab that has one filesystem with userquotas enabled.
/dev/wd0a / ffs rw,userquota=/var/quotas/quota.user 1 1

   Now it's time to set the user's quotas. To do so you use the utility
   [40]edquota(8). A simple use is just edquota <user>. edquota(8) will
   use vi(1) to edit the quotas unless the environmental variable EDITOR
   is set to a different editor. For example:
   # edquota ericj

   This will give you output similar to this:
Quotas for user ericj:
/: blocks in use: 62, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)
        inodes in use: 25, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)

   To add limits, edit it to give results like this:
Quotas for user ericj:
/: blocks in use: 62, limits (soft = 1000, hard = 1050)
        inodes in use: 25, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)

   In this the softlimit is set to 1000 blocks and the hardlimit is set
   to 1050 blocks. A softlimit is a limit where the user is just warned
   when they cross it and have until their grace period is up to get
   their disk usage below their limit. Grace periods can be set by using
   the -t option on edquota(8). After the grace period is over the
   softlimit is handled as a hardlimit. This usually results in an
   allocation failure.

   Now that the quotas are set, you need to turn the quotas on. To do
   this use [41]quotaon(8). For example:
# quotaon -a

   This will go thru /etc/fstab to turn on the filesystems with quota
   options. Now that quotas are up and running, you can view them by the
   [42]quota(1). Using a command of quota <user> will give that users
   information. When called with no arguments the quota command will give
   your quota statistics. For example:
# quota ericj

   Will result in output similar to this:
Disk quotas for user ericj (uid 1001):
     Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
              /      62    1000    1050              27       0       0

   By default quotas set in /etc/fstab will be started on boot. To turn
   them off use
# quotaoff -a

10.11 - How to Setup Kerberos Clients and Servers under OpenBSD

   As a user/administrator of OpenBSD systems, you are fortunate that
   KerberosIV is an pre-installed component of the default system. Here
   is a guide to setting up both the Kerberos realm server, as well as a
   client.

   An *EXTREMELY* important point to remember is that Kerberos clients
   and servers must have their system clocks synchronized. If there is
   more than a 5 minute time skew, you will receive wierd errors that do
   not immediately reveal themselves to be caused by time skew, such as:
kinit: Can't send request (send_to_kdc)

   Another more accurate error is:
kauth: Time is out of bounds (krb_rd_req)

   An easy way to synchronize system clocks is with xntpd, available in
   the ports tree at /usr/ports/sysutils/xntpd/.
   This FAQ entry assumes you have prior knowledge of the Kerberos
   concepts. For a great, easy to understand, reference, see:
     * [43]The FreeBSD handbook
     * Use the command info kth-krb
     * [44]Designing an Authentication System: a Dialogue in Four Scenes
     * [45]Papers and Documentation Describing KerberosIV

   Or the book
     * [46]Network Security Private Communication in a Public World
       [Kaufman, Perlman, Speciner, 1995]

  How to setup the Kerberos IV REALM and SERVER

   We will be setting up the CIARASYSTEMS.COM realm, with
   avalanche.ciarasystems.com as the main server.

   To start off, we will need to edit our configuration files. These
   files are located at /etc/kerberosIV/. The two files we are concerned
   about are krb.realms and krb.conf. Let's start off with krb.conf.
[root@avalanche kerberosIV] cat krb.conf
CIARASYSTEMS.COM
CIARASYSTEMS.COM avalanche.ciarasystems.com admin server

   As you can see, this tells kerberos that the domain is
   CIARASYSTEMS.COM (or logical realm) and that within that domain,
   avalanche is the administration server. Next we will look at
   krb.realms. For more information on this refer to [47]krb.conf.

avalanche.ciarasystems.com      CIARASYSTEMS.COM
.ciarasystems.com               CIARASYSTEMS.COM

   krb.realms provides a translation from a hostname to the Kerberos
   realm name for the services provided by that host. Each line of the
   translation file is in one of the following forms (domain_name should
   be of the form .XXX.YYY). So in this example, avalanche is the
   hostname of a computer on the CIARASYSTEMS.COM realm. And
   .ciarasystems.com is the domain name on the realm CIARASYSTEMS.COM.
   Again, for further information read the [48]krb.realms. man page.

   Next we will run [49]kdb_init(8) to create the initial Kerberos
   database.
[root@avalanche kerberosIV] kdb_init

You will be prompted for the database Master Password.
It is important that you NOT FORGET this password.

Enter Kerberos master password: not shown

   Next we need to use [50]kstash(8) which is used to save the Kerberos
   key distribution center (KDC) database master key in the master key
   cache file.

Wrote master key to /etc/kerberosIV/master_key
       This saves the encrypted master password in
       /etc/kerberosIV/master_key.
       Next, we need two principals to be added to the database for each
       system that will be secured with Kerberos. Their names are kpasswd
       and rcmd. These two principals are made for each system, with the
       instance being the name of the individual system. These daemons,
       kpasswd and rcmd allow other systems to change Kerberospasswords
       and run commands like rcp, rlogin and rsh.

   A srvtab file is the service key file. These must be extracted from
   the Kerberos key distribution center database in order for services to
   authenticate using Kerberos. For each hostname specified on the
   command line, [51]ext_srvtab(8) creates the service key file
   hostname-new-srvtab, containing all the entries in the database with
   an instance field of hostname.

   So now all the Kerberos particulars are setup. All that is left is to
   enable boot-time loading of the Kerberos server and to enable
   Kerberized-daemons.

   In /etc/rc.conf, set:
   kerberos_server=YES

   In /etc/inetd.conf, uncomment:
telnet       stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/telnetd    telnetd -k
klogin       stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/rlogind    rlogind -k
kshell       stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/rshd       rshd -k
kauth        stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/kauthd     kauthd

   Then, either reboot, or:
[root@avalanche /] kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`
[root@avalanche /] /usr/libexec/kerberos >> /var/log/kerberos.log &
[root@avalanche /] /usr/libexec/kadmind -n >> /var/log/kadmind.log &

   Note: this is a rather simple server setup. Usually, redundant servers
   are setup (as slave servers) so that if one server goes down, all the
   services that depend on Kerberos don't go down. We can also add 'su'
   privileges to a specific principal, see [52]the FreeBSD Handbook.

  How to kerberize your client workstation

   We will be setting the workstation named gatekeeper to be in the
   CIARASYSTEMS.COM realm, with avalanche.ciarasystems.com as the main
   server.

   To start off, we need to setup our krb.conf and krb.realms like the
   above machine. This is so gatekeeper will know what server is the KDC
   and what domain it is on. Again here are the file contents.
[root@gatekeeper kerberosIV] cat krb.conf
CIARASYSTEMS.COM
CIARASYSTEMS.COM avalanche.ciarasystems.com admin server

[root@gatekeeper kerberosIV] cat krb.realms
avalanche.ciarasystems.com      CIARASYSTEMS.COM
.ciarasystems.com               CIARASYSTEMS.COM

   Now that is set up, we need to initialize kerberos. To obtain a ticket
   you use [53]kinit(1).
xyz:jeremie% kinit
The OpenBSD Project (gatekeeper)
Kerberos Initialization
Kerberos name: jeremie
Password:

   Now we have identified we can list our tickets with [54]klist(1).
xyz:jeremie$ klist
Ticket file:    /tmp/tkt1000
Principal:      jeremie@CIARASYSTEMS.COM

  Issued           Expires          Principal
Jun 28 01:03:25  Jun 28 11:03:25  krbtgt.CIARASYSTEMS.COM@CIARASYSTEMS.COM

   Looks like we are set now. All that's left to do is test it. Here we
   will test it with rlogin(1) and telnet(1).
xyz:jeremie% telnet avalanche

   We can tell that it is indeed using Kerberos to authenticate the
   rlogin session. To get rid of any tickets issued, you would use
   [55]kdestroy(1). For example:
xyz:jeremie% kdestroy
Tickets destroyed.
xyz:jeremie% rlogin avalanche
krcmd: No ticket file (tf_util)
rlogin: warning, using standard rlogin: can't provide Kerberos auth data.
avalanche: Connection refused

   Do not worry about 'Warning: no Kerberos tickets issued.' This is
   because we're only doing kerberos authentication, not ticket passing.
   If you want ticket passing, use [56]OpenSSH which has support. Stock
   KerberosIV doesn't have support for tgt passing, either - only the AFS
   kaserver's implementation of krb4, since the regular KerberosIV kdc
   checks client IP address listed in the ticket.

10.12 - Setting up Anonymous FTP Services.

   Anonymous FTP allows users without accounts to access files on your
   computer via the File Transfer Protocol. This will give an overview of
   setting up the anonymous FTP server, and its logging, etc.

  Adding the FTP account

   To start off, you need to have an account on your system of "ftp".
   This account shouldn't have a useable password. Here we will set the
   login directory to /home/ftp, but you can put it wherever you want.
   When using anonymous ftp, the ftp daemon will chroot itself to the
   home directory of the 'ftp' user. To read up more on that, read the
   [57]ftp(8) and [58]chroot(2) man pages. Here is an example of adding
   the ftp user. I will do this using [59]adduser(8). We also need to add
   /bin/false to our /etc/shells, this is the "shell" that we will be
   giving to the ftp user. This won't allow them to login, even though we
   will give them an empty password. To do this you can simply echo
   /bin/false >> /etc/shells. Also if you wish for that shell to show up
   during the adduser questions, you need to modify /etc/adduser.conf.
oshibana# adduser
Use option ``-silent'' if you don't want see all warnings & questions.

Reading /etc/shells
Check /etc/master.passwd
Check /etc/group

Ok, let's go.
Don't worry about mistakes. I will give you the chance later to correct any inp
ut.
Enter username [a-z0-9_]: ftp
Enter full name []: anonymous ftp
Enter shell csh false ksh nologin sh tcsh zsh [sh]: false
Uid [1002]:
Login group ftp [ftp]:
Login group is ``ftp''. Invite ftp into other groups: guest no
[no]: no
Enter password []:
Use an empty password? (y/n) [y]: y

Name:     ftp
Password: ****
Fullname: anonymous ftp
Uid:      1002
Gid:      1002 (ftp)
Groups:   ftp
HOME:     /home/ftp
Shell:    /usr/bin/false
OK? (y/n) [y]: y
Added user ``ftp''
Copy files from /usr/share/skel to /home/ftp
Add another user? (y/n) [y]: n
Goodbye!

  Directory Setup

   Along with the user, this created the directory /home/ftp. This is
   what we want, but there are some changes that we will have to make to
   get it ready for anonymous ftp. Again these changes are explained in
   the [60]ftp(8) man page.
   You do not need to make a /home/ftp/usr or /home/ftp/bin directory.
     * /home/ftp - This is the main directory. It should be owned by root
       and have permissions of 555.
     * /home/ftp/etc - This is entirely optional and not recommended, as
       it only serves to give out information on users which exist on
       your box. If you want your anonymous ftp directory to appear to
       have real users attached to your files, you should copy
       /etc/pwd.db and /etc/group to this directory. This directory
       should be mode 511, and the two files should be mode 444. These
       are used to give owner names as opposed to numbers. There are no
       passwords stored in pwd.db, they are all in spwd.db, so don't copy
       that over.
     * /home/ftp/pub - This is a standard directory to place files in
       which you wish to share. This directory should also be mode 555.

   Note that all these directories should be owned by ''root''. Here is a
   listing of what the directories should look like after their creation.
oshibana# pwd
/home
oshibana# ls -laR ftp

dr-xr-xr-x  5 root  ftp    512 Jul  6 11:33 .

dr-xr-xr-x  2 root  ftp  512 Jul  6 11:33 .
dr-xr-xr-x  5 root  ftp  512 Jul  6 11:33 ..

  Starting up the server and logging

   With ftpd you can choose to either run it from inetd or the rc scripts
   can kick it off. These examples will show our daemon being started
   from [61]inetd.conf. First we must become familiar with some of the
   options to ftpd. The default line from /etc/inetd.conf is:
ftp             stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/ftpd       ftpd -U
S

   Here ftpd is invoked with -US. This will log anonymous connections to
   /var/log/ftpd and concurrent sessions to /var/run/utmp. That will
   allow for these sessions to be seen via who(1). For some, you might
   want to run only an anonymous server, and disallow ftp for users. To
   do so you should invoke ftpd with the -A option. Here is a line that
   starts ftpd up for anonymous connections only. It also uses -ll which
   logs each connection to syslog, along with the get, retrieve, etc, ftp
   commands.
ftp             stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/tcpd       ftpd -l
lUSA

   Note - For people using HIGH traffic ftp servers, you might want to
   not invoke ftpd from inetd.conf. The best option is to comment the
   ftpd line from inetd.conf and start ftpd from rc.conf along with the
   -D option. This will start ftpd as a daemon, and has much less
   overhead as starting it from inetd. Here is an example line to start
   it from rc.conf.
ftpd_flags="-DllUSA"           # for non-inetd use: ftpd_flags="-D"

   This of course only works if you have ftpd taken out of
   /etc/inetd.conf.

  Other relevant files

     * /etc/ftpwelcome - This holds the Welcome message for people once
       they have connected to your ftp server.
     * /etc/motd - This holds the message for people once they have
       successfully logged into your ftp server.
     * .message - This file can be placed in any directory. It will be
       shown once a user enters that directory.

10.13 - Confining users to their home dir's in ftpd(8).

   OpenBSD's [62]ftpd(8) is setup by default to be able to handle this
   very easily. This is accomplished via the file /etc/ftpchroot. Since
   users cannot always be trusted, it might be necessary to restrain them
   to their home directories. This behavior is NOT on by default. Here is
   an example of what the default behavior is like.
$ ftp localhost

   As you can see here, access is granted to the whole server. In a
   perfect world this is ok, where all users can be trusted, but this
   isn't so. To limit a user, simply add their name to the file
   /etc/ftpchroot. Here is an example showing user "ericj" being
   restricted.
$ cat /etc/ftpchroot
#       $OpenBSD: obsd-faq.txt,v 1.24 2001/06/14 22:57:02 fgsch Exp $
#
# list of users (one per line) given ftp access to a chrooted area.
# read by ftpd(8).
ericj

   This is enough to keep the user "ericj" from escaping from his own
   directory. As you can see in the next example. The / directory has
   suddenly changed to his home dir!

     _________________________________________________________________

11.1 - In 2.4 why do I get UserDir error when running httpd?

   It seems as though userdir support was left out of 2.4. Make sure to
   pick up the patch at:

   [4]http://www.openbsd.org/errata24.html

11.2 - Installing at a partition 4GB or higher

   The 2.4 cd's shipped with a problem in installboot. A patch can be
   obtained here [5]http://www.openbsd.org/errata.html. This is fixed in
   -current.

   To place the partition boot record, installboot used a 32 bit
   multiplication for the sectors times the sectorsize which is larger
   than 2^32 -1 (i.e. multiplication overflow) when the partition starts
   at 4 GB or higher. This means the pbr is installed in the real
   partition address modulo 4GB. It's still possible to install at >= 4GB
   with some effort:

   You have 2 Options for doing so with OpenBSD 2.4. If you have Linux or
   any other unix like OS, you should back up the sectors first before
   trying anything.

     * Suppose the partition starts at cylinder 611, and the drive has
       255 heads, 63 sectors: offset for the obsd partition is
       611*255*63= 9815715 sectors. multiply this by 512 and you get:
       5025646080. 5025646080 mod 2^32 = 730678784
       (You can just subtract 2^32 on a hand calculator...) dividing by
       512 gives sector 1427107.
       Ok, suppose were now in linux (where cylinder numbers are 1 higher
       btw..) and that the obsd partition is DOS partition 4:
       dd if=/dev/hda of=backup.txt skip=1427107 bs=512 count=1
       will backup the data that installboot will nuke ..
       Now install OpenBSD. Return to Linux.
       Now we're going to copy the partition boot record to the right
       place.
       dd if=/dev/hda of=pbr.txt skip=1427107 bs=512 count=1
       dd if=/pbr.txt of=/dev/hda4 bs=512 count=1
       (adding obsd to lilo should now work)
       Now write back the nuked sector:
       dd if=/backup.txt of=/dev/hda seek=1427107 bs=512 count=1
       Caveat: make sure that whatever gets nuked by installboot isn't
       essential to running dd (and starting the other OS). Backing up
       the affected partition is recommended.
     * Use a correct version of installboot (compiled for you by another
       OBSD'er ..):
       put it on another partition, e.g. a DOS partition. Suppose wd0j is
       the DOS partition (see disklabel wd0, this is in case of IDE
       disks), and installboot is named installb there.
       After booting from floppy/CD, press ^C to get into the shell:
          + mkdir dos
          + mount /dev/wd0j dos
          + cp dos/tmp/installb /usr/mdec/installboot

   Now enter 'install' and the installation procedure should use the new
   installboot.

11-2.5 - OpenBSD 2.5 Specific Information
     _________________________________________________________________

     * [2]Tuning kmem
     * [3]OpenBSD 2.5 installation walkthrough
     _________________________________________________________________

11.1 - Swapping in OpenBSD 2.5

   (Note: if you are looking to swap to a file because you are getting
   "virtual memory exhausted" errors, you should try raising the
   per-process limits first with csh's [4]unlimit(1), or sh's
   [5]ulimit(1).)

   OpenBSD 2.5 uses [6]swapon to deal with swapping. Swapping to a file
   doesn't require a custom built kernel, although that can still be
   done, this faq will show you how to add swap space both ways.

  Swapping to a file.

   Swapping to a file is easiest and quickest way to get extra swap
   area's setup. This is not for users who are currently using
   Softupdates. (Which isn't enabled by default). To start out, you can
   see how much swap you are currently have and how much you are using
   with the [7]pstat(8) utility. You can do this by using the command:
ericj@oshibana> pstat -s
Device      512-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Priority
swap_device      65520        8    65512     0%    0

   This shows the devices currently being used for swapping and their
   current statistics. In the above example there is only one device
   named "swap_device". This is the predefined area on disk that is used
   for swapping. (Shows up as partition b when viewing disklabels) As you
   can also see in the above example, that device isn't getting much use
   at the moment. But for the purposes of this document, we will act as
   if an extra 32M is needed.

   The first step to setting up a file as a swap device is to create the
   file. It's best to do this with the [8]dd(1) utility. Here is an
   example of creating the file /var/swap that is 32M large.
ericj@oshibana> sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap bs=1k count=32768
32768+0 records in
32768+0 records out
33554432 bytes transferred in 20 secs (1677721 bytes/sec)

   Once this has been done, we can turn on swapping to that device. Use
   the following command to turn on swapping to this device
ericj@oshibana> sudo swapon -a /var/swap

   Now we need to check to see if it has been correctly added to the list
   of our swap devices.
ericj@oshibana> pstat -s
Device      512-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Priority
swap_device      65520        8    65512     0%    0
/var/swap        65536        0    65536     0%    0
Total           131056        8   131048     0%

   Now that the file is setup and swapping is being done, you need to add
   a line to your /etc/fstab file so that this file is configured on the
   next boot time also. If this line is not added, your won't have this
   swap device configured.
ericj@oshibana> cat /etc/fstab
/dev/wd0a / ffs rw 1 1
/var/swap /var/swap sw 0 0

  Swapping via a vnode device

   This is a more permanent solution to adding more swap space. To swap
   to a file permanently, first make a kernel with vnd0c as swap. If you
   have wd0a as root filesystem, wd0b is the previous swap, use this line
   in the kernel configuration file (refer to compiling a new kernel if
   in doubt):
config          bsd     root on wd0a swap on wd0b and vnd0c dumps on wd0b

   After this is done, the file which will be used for swapping needs to
   be created. You should do this by using the same command as in the
   above examples.
ericj@oshibana> sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap bs=1k count=32768
32768+0 records in
32768+0 records out
33554432 bytes transferred in 20 secs (1677721 bytes/sec)

   Now your file is in place, you need to add the file to you /etc/fstab.
   Here is a sample line to boot with this device as swap on boot.
ericj@oshibana> cat /etc/fstab
/dev/wd0a / ffs rw 1 1
/dev/vnd0c none swap sw 0 0

   At this point your computer needs to be rebooted so that the kernel
   changes can take place. Once this has been done it's time to configure
   the device as swap. To do this you will use [9]vnconfig(1).
ericj@oshibana> sudo vnconfig -c -v vnd0 /var/swap
vnd0: 33554432 bytes on /var/swap

   Now for the last step, turning on swapping to that device. We will do
   this just like in the above examples, using swapon(8). Then we will
   check to see if it was correctly added to our list of swap devices.
ericj@oshibana> sudo swapon -a /dev/vnd0c
ericj@oshibana> pstat -s
Device      512-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Priority
swap_device      65520        8    65512     0%    0
/dev/vnd0c       65536        0    65536     0%    0
Total           131056        8   131048     0%

11.2 - Tuning kmem

   If you are running 2.5 (these steps are not necessary for OpenBSD
   2.6), and if you start using the [10]performance tuning measures, you
   may start running out of kernel memory. If you start getting panics
   like "out of space in kmem_map" then you need to try
   option NKMEMCLUSTERS=8192

   Note that 8192 is valid for the i386 architecture, but may be too
   little or too much for others. Look at /usr/include/machine/param.h to
   see more information.

   If you ever get a panic "vm_map_entry_create: out of map entries", you
   may also want to increase the number of static kernel maps and
   entries. The default value for these options is architecture dependent
   and is specified in /sys/vm/vm_map.h. If you are using soft updates,
   the following values should keep you going!
   option MAX_KMAP=120
       option MAX_KMAPENT=6000

11.0 - Performance Tuning
     _________________________________________________________________

   Table of Contents
     * [1]11.1 - Networking
     * [2]11.2 - Disk I/O
     * [3]11.3 - Tuning kmem
     * [4]11.4 - Hardware Choices
     * [5]11.5 - Why aren't we using async mounts?
     _________________________________________________________________

11.1 - Networking

   If you run a busy server, gateway or firewall, you should make sure to
   prevent memory starvation to various parts of the kernel described
   below.

   The [6]options(4) man page talks about the options presented.

   An option you may need to change for a busy server, gateway or
   firewall is NMBCLUSTERS. This controls the size of the kernel mbuf
   cluster map. On your computer, if you get messages like "mb_map full",
   you need to increase this value. If traffic on a networking interface
   stops for no apparent reason, this may also be a sign that you need to
   increase this value. A reasonable value on the i386 port with most
   100Mbps ethernet interfaces (no matter how many the machine has) is
   8192.
   option NMBCLUSTERS=8192

11.2 - Disk I/O

   Disk I/O speed is a significant factor in the overall speed of your
   computer. It becomes increasingly important when your computer is
   hosting a multi-user environment (users of all kinds, from those who
   log-in interactively to those who see you as a file-server or a
   web-server.) Data storage constantly needs attention, especially when
   your partitions run out of space and when your disks fail. OpenBSD has
   several options to increase the speed of your disk operations and
   provide fault tolerance.

  CCD

       The first option is the use of [7]ccd(4), the Concatenated Disk
       Driver. This allows you to join several partitions into one
       virtual disk (and thus, you can make several disks look like one
       disk). This concept is similar to that of LVM (logical volume
       management), which is found in many commercial Unix flavors.
       If you are running GENERIC, ccd is already enabled. If not, you
       may need to add it to your kernel configuration. To start the
       setup of ccd, you need to add support for it in your kernel. A
       line such as:

pseudo-device   ccd     4       # concatenated disk devices

   The above example gives you up to 4 ccd devices (virtual disks). Now
   you need to figure out what partitions on your real disks that you
   want to dedicate to ccd. Use disklabel to mark these partitions as
   type 'ccd'. On some architectures, disklabel may not allow you to do
   this. In this case, mark them as 'ffs'.

   If you are using ccd to gain performance by striping, note that you
   will not get optimum performance unless you use the same model of
   disks with the same disklabel settings.

   Edit /etc/ccd.conf to look something like this: (for more information
   on configuring ccd, look at [8]ccdconfig(8))
# Configuration file for concatenated disk devices
#
# ccd   ileave  flags   component devices
ccd0   16      none    /dev/sd2e /dev/sd3e

   To make your changes take effect, run
# ccdconfig -C

   As long as /etc/ccd.conf exists, ccd will automatically configure
   itself upon boot. Now, you have a new disk, ccd0, a combination of
   /dev/sd2e and /dev/sd3e. Just use disklabel on it like you normally
   would to make the partition or partitions you want to use. Again,
   don't use the 'c' partition as an actual partition that you put stuff
   on. Make sure your useable partitions are at least one cylinder off
   from the beginning of the disk.

  RAID

       Another solution is [9]raid(4) which will have you use
       [10]raidctl(8) to control your raid devices. OpenBSD's RAID is
       based upon Greg Oster's [11]NetBSD port of the CMU [12]RAIDframe
       software. OpenBSD has support for RAID levels of 0, 1, 4, and 5.
       With raid, as with ccd, support must be in the KERNEL. Unlike ccd,
       support for RAID is not found in GENERIC, it must be compiled into
       your kernel (RAID support adds some 500K to the size of an i386
       kernel!)

pseudo-device   raid   4       # RAIDframe disk device

   Setting up RAID on some operating systems is confusing and painful to
   say the least. Not so with RAIDframe. Read the [13]raid(4) and
   [14]raidctl(8) man pages to get full details. There are many options
   and possible configurations, a detailed explanation is beyond the
   scope of this document.

  Filesystem Buffer

   For fileservers with memory to spare, you can increase
       BUFCACHEPERCENT. That is, what percentage of your RAM should you
       use as a file system buffer. This option may change when the
       Unified Buffer Cache is completed and is part of OpenBSD. In the
       mean time, to increase BUFCACHEPERCENT, you should add a line to
       your kernel configuration like this:

   option BUFCACHEPERCENT=30

   Of course you can make it as low as 5 percent (the default) or as high
   as 50 percent (or more.)

  Soft updates

   Another tool that can be used to speed up your system is softupdates.
       One of the slowest operations in the traditional BSD file system
       is updating metainfo (which happens, among other times, when you
       create or delete files and directories.) Softupdates attempts to
       update metainfo in RAM instead of writing to the hard disk each
       and every single metainfo update. Another effect of this is that
       the metainfo on disk should always be complete, although not
       always up to date. So, a system crash should not require fsck upon
       boot up, but simply a background version of fsck that makes
       changes to the metainfo in RAM (a la softupdates). This means
       rebooting a server is much faster, because you don't have to wait
       for fsck! (OpenBSD does not have this feature yet.) You can read
       more about softupdates in the [15]softupdates FAQ entry.

11.3 - Tuning kmem

   This was moved to the [16]OpenBSD 2.5 information section.

11.4 - Hardware choices

   (Note- this section is heavily centered around the i386, or PC,
   architecture. That is to say... other architectures don't give you
   quite as many choices!)

   The performance of your applications depends heavily on your OS and
   the facilities it provides. This may be part of the reason that you
   are using OpenBSD. The performance of your applications also depends
   heavily on your hardware. For many folks, the Price/Performance ratio
   of a brand new PC with a Intel Pentium III or AMD Athlon processor is
   much better then the Price/Performance ratio of a Sun UltraSparc 60!
   Of course, the price of OpenBSD can't be beat.

   If you are shopping for a new PC, whether you are buying it piece by
   piece or completely pre-built, you want to make sure first that you
   are buying reliable parts. In the PC world, this is not easy. Bad or
   otherwise unreliable or mismatched parts can make OpenBSD run poorly
   and crash often. The best advice we can give is to be careful, buy
   brands and parts that have been reviewed by an authority you trust.
   Sometimes, when you skimp on the price of a PC, you lose in quality!

   There are certain things that will help bring out the maximum
   performance of your hardware:
     * Use multiple disks.
       Instead of buying one 20GB disk, buy multiple 9GB disks. While
       this may cost more, distributing the load over multiple spindles
       will decrease the amount of time necessary to access data on the
       disks. And, with more spindles, you will get more reliability and
       faster data access with RAID.
     * Use SCSI if you need very high disk IO speeds.
       IDE disks normally run at 5400 RPM, with new disks emerging from
       manufacturers that run at 7200 RPM. Using high end IDE disks, it
       may be unreasonable to expect more then 15 to 20 megabytes per
       second of throughput from a single disk. Using high end SCSI disks
       (higher cost 10000 RPM disks), you can achieve performance higher
       then this. Conversely, if you are using medium or low end SCSI
       disks, this is a waste of money, and IDE will serve you just as
       well, if not better.
       If you are building a server, and you need more then 20GB of disk
       space, you may want to consider SCSI. IDE limits you to two disks
       per controller. Concurrent access to these two disks may have a
       negative impact on the I/O performance of these disks. Wide SCSI
       limits you to 15 per controller! While SCSI costs more, the
       flexibility and performance can justify these costs in some
       environments.
     * Use SDRAM instead of DRAM.
       This option applies mainly to PCs. Most other architectures don't
       give you a choice of what kind of RAM you can use. Several PCs
       still do. You will get better performance with SDRAM versus DRAM
       (SIMMs). If your system supports RDRAM or some other new type of
       RAM, then you are already one step ahead...
     * Use ECC or parity RAM.
       Parity adds some functionality to see if the data in RAM has been
       corrupted. ECC extends this functionality and attempts to correct
       some bit corruption errors on the fly. This option applies mainly
       to PCs. Most other architectures simply require parity or ECC
       capable RAM. Several non-PC computers won't even boot with
       non-parity RAM. If you aren't using ECC/parity RAM, you may get
       data corruption and other abnormalities. Several manufacturers of
       "cheap PC RAM" don't even make an ECC variety! This will help you
       avoid them! PC manufacturers often sell several product lines,
       divided around "servers" and "workstations." The servers will
       incorporate ECC RAM into their architecture. Unix workstation
       manufacturers have been using parity (and now ECC) for several
       years in all of their product lines.
     * Avoid ISA devices.
       While most folks avoid ISA devices, because they are generally
       hard to configure and out of date, there are still plenty in
       existence. If you are using the ISA bus for your disk or network
       controllers, (or even worse, for both) remember that the ISA bus
       itself can be a performance bottleneck. If you need speed, look to
       PCI. Of course, there are still several ISA bus cards that work
       just fine. Unfortunately, most of these are sound cards and serial
       port cards.
     * Avoid cheap PCI network adapters.
       OpenBSD supports a plethora of cheap PCI network adapters. These
       adapters work great in home systems, and also low or moderate
       throughput business and research enviroments. But, if you need
       high throughput and low impact on your server, you are better off
       buying a quality PCI network adapter. Unfortunately, some
       expensive brand adapters (such as the 3com XL series) are not much
       better then the cheap adapters. One favorite 10/100Mbps adapter is
       the Intel EtherExpress PRO/100.

11.5 - Why aren't we using async mounts?

   Question: "I simply do "mount -u -o async /" which makes one package I
   use (which insists on touching a few hundred things from time to time)
   useable. Why is async mounting frowned upon and not on by default (as
   it is in some other unixen) ? Surely it is much simpler and therefore
   a safer way of improving performance in some applications ?"

   Answer: "Async mounts is indeed faster then sync mounts, but they are
   also less safe. What happens in case of a power failure? Or a hardware
   problem? The quest for speed should not sacrifice the reliabilty and
   the stability of the system. Check the manpage for [17]mount(8)."
             async   All I/O to the file system should be done asynchronously.
                     This is a dangerous flag to set since it does not guaran-
                     tee to keep a consistent file system structure on the
                     disk.  You should not use this flag unless you are pre-
                     pared to recreate the file system should your system
                     crash.  The most common use of this flag is to speed up
                     restore(8) where it can give a factor of two speed in-
                     crease.

   On the other hand, when you are dealing with temp data that you can
   recreate from scratch after a crash, you could gain speed by using a
   separate partition, used for that data only, mounted async. If you
   don't mind risking the loss of all the data in the partition when
   something goes wrong...

     _________________________________________________________________

   By advanced users, we mean to imply people who have a working
   knowledge of how to use and administrate a Unix-like operating system.
   If you follow instructions in this section without understanding what
   you are doing, you may cause problems in the operation of your system.

12.1 - Forcing DMA access for IDE disks

   With the PCI IDE code, your chipset may not be known. If so, you will
   get a message like:
pciide0: DMA, (unused)

   If you get this message, you can try and force DMA mode by using
   'flags 0x0001' on your pciide entry in your kernel config file. That
   would look something like this:
pciide* at pci ? dev ? function ? flags 0x0001

   After doing this, the pciide code will try to use DMA mode regardless
   of whether or not it actually knows how to do so with your chipset. If
   this works, and your system makes it through fsck and startup, it is
   likely that this will work for good. If this does not work, and the
   system hangs or panics after booting, then you can't use DMA mode
   (yet, until support is added for your chipset). Note that if you find
   the documentation for your PCI-IDE controller's chipset, this is a
   good start to fully supporting your chipset within the PCI-IDE code.
   You can look on the manufacturer's website or call them. If your
   PCI-IDE controller is part of your motherboard, figure out who
   manufactures the chipset and pursue their resources!

   Note that you will know that DMA support has been enabled if you see
   this message:
cd0(pciide0:1:0): using PIO mode 3, DMA mode 1 (using DMA data transfers)

   This means that pciide0, channel 1, drive 0 (which appears to be an
   ATAPI CD-ROM) is using DMA data transfers.

   Some notes:

   DMA is not supported on wdc* unless a DMA channel (drq) is specified.
   I'm not sure what the "standard" drqs are for hard disk controllers.
   To enable
wdc0    at isa? port 0x1f0 irq 14 flags 0x00

   Non-ultra DMA does not necessarily lead to higher bandwidth vs PIO.
   However, it decreases the CPU load significantly.

                             13.1 - What is IPSec?

   IPSec is a set of extensions to the IP protocol family. It provides
   cryptographic security services. These services allow for
   authentication, integrity, access control, and confidentiality. IPSec
   provides similar services as SSL, but at the network layer, in a way
   that is completely transparent to your applications, and much more
   powerful. We say this because your applications do not have to have
   any knowledge of IPSec to be able to use it. You can use [18]any IP
   protocol over IPSec. You can create encrypted tunnels (VPNs), or just
   do encryption between computers. Since you have so many options, IPSec
   is rather complex (much more so then SSL!)

   Before you start using IPSec, we strongly recommend that you check out
   the "recommended reading" of [19]part 6 of the FAQ. In particular, if
   you don't already understand it, the [20]Understanding IP Addressing
   document is highly recommended.

   In a logical sense, IPSec works in any of these three ways:
     * Host-to-Host
     * Host-to-Network
     * Network-to-Network

   In every scenario that involves a network, we mean to imply router. As
   in, Host-to-Router (and this router controls and encrypts traffic for
   a particular Network.)

   As you can see, IPSec can be used to tunnel traffic for VPN
   connections. However, its utility reaches beyond VPNs. With a central
   Internet Key Exchange registry, every machine on the internet could
   talk to another one and employ powerful encryption and authentication!

              13.2 - That's nice, but why do I want to use IPSec?

   The internet protocol, IP, aka IPv4, does not inherently provide any
   protection to your transferred data. It does not even guarantee that
   the sender is who he says he is. IPSec tries to remedy this. These
   services are considered distinct, but the IPSec supports them in a
   uniform manner.

    Confidentiality

   Make sure it is hard for anyone but the receiver to understand what
   data has been communicated. You do not want anyone to see your
   passwords when logging into a remote machine over the Internet.

    Integrity

   Guarantee that the data does not get changed on the way. If you are on
   a line carrying invoicing data you probably want to know that the
   amounts and account numbers are correct and not altered while
   in-transit.

    Authenticity

   Sign your data so that others can see that it is really you that sent
   it. It is clearly nice to know that documents are not forged.

    Replay protection

   We need ways to ensure a transaction can only be carried out once
   unless we are authorized to repeat it. I.e. it should not be possible
   for someone to record a transaction, and then replaying it verbatim,
   in order to get an effect of multiple transactions being received by
   the peer. Consider the attacker has got to know what the traffic is
   all about by other means than cracking the encryption, and that the
   traffic causes events favourable for him, like depositing money into
   his account. We need to make sure he cannot just replay that traffic
   later. WARNING: as per the standards specification, replay protection
   is not performed when using manual-keyed IPsec (e.g., when using
   [21]ipsecadm(8)).

                  13.3 - What are the protocols behind IPSec?

   IPSec provides confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and replay
   protection through two new protocols. These protocols are called AH,
   Authentication header, and ESP, Encapsulated security payload.

   AH provides authentication, integrity, and replay protection (but not
   confidentiality). Its main difference with ESP is that AH also secures
   parts of the IP header of the packet (like the source/destination
   addresses).

   ESP can provide authentication, integrity, replay protection, and
   confidentiality of the data (it secures everything in the packet that
   follows the header). Replay protection requires authentication and
   integrity (these two go always together). Confidentiality (encryption)
   can be used with or without authentication/integrity. Similarly, one
   could use authentication/integrity with or without confidentiality.

                           13.4 - On the wire format

   The Authentication Header (AH) comes after the basic IP header and
   contains cryptographic hashes of the data and identification
   information. The hashes can also cover the invariant parts of the IP
   header itself. There are several different RFCs giving a choice of
   actual algorithms to use in the AH, however they all must follow the
   guidelines specified in [22]RFC2402.

   The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) header, allows for rewriting
   of the payload in encrypted form. The ESP header does not consider the
   fields of the IP header before it and therefore makes no guarantees
   about anything except the payload. The various types of ESP applicable
   must follow [23]RFC2406. An ESP header can also provide authentication
   for the payload, (but not the outer header).

   An orthogonal (mostly) division of IPSec functionality is applied
   depending on whether the endpoint doing the IPSec encapsulation is the
   original source of the data or a gateway:
     * Transport mode is used by a host that is generating the packets.
       In transport mode, the security headers are added before the
       transport layer (e.g . TCP, UDP) headers, before the IP header is
       prepended to the packet. In other words an AH added to the packet
       will cover the hashing of the TCP header and some fields of the
       end-to-end IP header, and an ESP header will cover the encryption
       of the TCP header and the data, but not the end-to-end IP header.
     * Tunnel mode is used when the end-to-end IP header is already
       attached to the packet, and one of the ends of the secure
       connection is only a gateway. In this mode, the AH and ESP headers
       are used to cover the entire packet including the end-to-end
       header, and a new IP header is repended to the packet that covers
       just the hop to the other end of the secure connection (though
       that may of course be several IP hops away).

   IPSec secured links are defined in terms of Security Associations
   (SAs). Each SA is defined for a single unidirectional flow of data,
   and usually (ignoring multicast) from one single point to another,
   covering traffic distinguishable by some unique selector. All traffic
   flowing over a single SA is treated the same. Some traffic may be
   subject to several SAs, each of which applies some transform. Groups
   of SAs are called an SA Bundle. Incoming packets can be assigned to a
   particular SA by the three defining fields, (Destination IP address,
   Security Parameter Index, security protocol). SPI can be considered a
   cookie that is handed out by the receiver of the SA when the
   parameters of the connection are negotiated. The security protocol
   must be either AH or ESP. Since the IP address of the receiver is part
   of the triple, this is a guaranteed unique value. They can be found
   from the outer IP header and the first security header (which contains
   the SPI and the security protocol).

   An example of a tunnel mode AH packet is:

   IPhdr AH IPhdr2 TCPhdr data

   An example of a transport mode AH packet is:

   IPhdr AH TCPhdr data

   Because an ESP header cannot authenticate the outer IP header, it is
   useful to combine an AH and an ESP header to get the following:

   IPhdr AH ESP TCPhdr data

   This is called Transport Adjacency. The tunnelling version would look
   like:

   IPhdr AH ESP IPhdr2 TCPhdr data

   However it is not specifically mentioned in the RFC. As with Transport
   adjacency, this would authenticate the entire packet except a few
   headers in the IP header and also encrypt the payload, (seen in
   italics). When an AH and an ESP header are diectly applied together
   like this, the order of the headers should be as shown. It is possible
   in tunnel mode, to do arbitrary recursive encapsulation so that order
   is not specified.

                           13.5 - Configuring IPSec

   How the IPSec systems and gateways are configured is to some extent
   left to the designer, however the RFC has some strong recomendations
   as to how this should be implemented, so as to minimize confusion.

   There are two administrative entities that control what happens to a
   packet. One is the Security Association Database (SAD, referred to as
   TDB or TDB table throughout OpenBSD's IPSec source code) and the other
   is the Security Policy Database (SPD).

   They are similar in that given a number of selectors that describe
   some traffic, they will deliver an entry that describes the processing
   needed. However, the SPD is two steps removed from the actual
   processing: the SPD is used for outgoing packets, to decide what SAD
   entries should be used, and the SAD entries in turn describe the
   actual process and the parameters for it. The SPD entries specify the
   existing SAD entries to use (if it's a bundle there can be more than
   1), but if there is not already a suitable one, it is used to create
   new ones. The fields of the SA being created can be taken either from
   the SPD entry or from the packet that initiated the creation.

   Outgoing packets go from the SPD entry to the specific SA, to get
   encoding parameters. Incoming packets get to the correct SA directly
   using the SPI/DestIP/Proto triple, and from there get to the SPD
   entry.

   The SPD can also specify what traffic should bypass IPSec and what
   should be dropped, so it must also be consulted for incoming non-IPSec
   traffic. SPD entries must be explicitly ordered as several might match
   a particular packet, and the processing must be reproducible.

   The SPD can be though of as similar to a packet filter where the
   actions decided upon are the activation of SA processes. Selectors can
   include src and dest address, port numbers if relevant, application
   and user IDs if available (only on host based transport SAs),
   hostnames, security sensitivity levels, protocols, etc.

   A SAD entry would include:
     * Dest IP address
     * IPSec proto (SA or ESP)
     * SPI (cookie)
     * Sequence counter
     * Seq O/F flag
     * Anti-replay window info
     * AH type and info
     * ESP type and info
     * Lifetime info
     * Tunnel/transport mode flags
     * Path MTU info

   A SPD entry would contain:
     * Pointer to active SAs
     * Selector fields

   Each SA can define one ESP header and one AH header. An IPSec session
   must have one or the other or both, but cannot be defined with neither
   - otherwise there would be no headers to specify the SPI to look up
   the SA. The RFC doesn't say what would happen if the AH and ESP
   headers disagree about the SPI value. One would presume this would
   imply multiple SAs in a bundle.

   The SPD in OpenBSD is managed through the ipsecadm flow command. (You
   would only make changes to it if you are using manual keying.) SAD
   entries can be set manually with [24]ipsecadm(8), however the IETF has
   also defined automatic mechanisms for initialization of sessions and
   such things as key exchange. OpenBSD implements both Photuris
   ([25]RFC2522, and [26]RFC2523) and ISAKMP automatic key exchange
   ([27]RFC2407, [28]RFC2408, and [29]RFC2409) in the [30]photurisd(8)
   and [31]isakmpd(8) daemons.

                13.6 - How do I setup IPSec with manual keying?

   Manual keying is the easiest way to get started with IPSec. You can
   setup encryption between networks, to create VPNs using this method.
   After you have read this section, you may want to investigate using
   [32]/usr/share/ipsec/rc.vpn to set this up for you automatically.

   First, you need to turn on IP AH and IP ESP options in the OpenBSD
   kernel (if you are only using ESP, such as with the rc.vpn script, or
   as with the example below, then you do not need to enable AH. In fact,
   there may even be security concerns related to enabling AH if you are
   not using it).

   There is a nice sysctl to enable these protocols.
   # sysctl -w net.inet.esp.enable=1
       net.inet.esp.enable: 0 -> 1
       # sysctl -w net.inet.ah.enable=1
       net.inet.ah.enable: 0 -> 1

   You can edit /etc/sysctl.conf to turn these on at boot time. You need
   to remove the # mark from in front of net.inet.esp.enable and/or
   net.inet.ah.enable (depending on which you plan to use) and make sure
   they are set to 1.

   Now, you need to setup SAs, or Security Associations. A Security
   Association is a combination of your IP addresses, an SPI, and your
   security protocol (AH and/or ESP). The IP addresses are both your own
   and that of your destination. The SPI, or Security Parameter Index, is
   a number that OpenBSD uses to classify different SAs.

   These examples only use ESP to encrypt your traffic. ESP includes
   authentication of the contained encrypted data, but does not
   authenticate the surrounding IP header, as AH would. This "limited
   authentication" is nevertheless quite sufficient in most cases,
   especially for ESP in a tunnel environment.

   # ipsecadm new esp -spi SPI_OUT -src MY_EXTERNAL_IP -dst
       PEER_EXTERNAL_IP -forcetunnel -enc blf -auth sha1 -key ENC_KEY
       -authkey AUTH_KEY

   Let's put this into practice with two routers, 192.168.5.1 and
   192.168.25.9.

   On Host 192.168.5.1:
   # ipsecadm new esp -spi 1000 -src 192.168.5.1 -dst 192.168.25.9
       -forcetunnel -enc blf -auth sha1 -key
       7762d8707255d974168cbb1d274f8bed4cbd3364 -authkey
       6a20367e21c66e5a40739db293cf2ef2a4e6659f
       # ipsecadm new esp -spi 1001 -dst 192.168.5.1 -src 192.168.25.9
       -forcetunnel -enc blf -auth sha1 -key
       7762d8707255d974168cbb1d274f8bed4cbd3364 -authkey
       6a20367e21c66e5a40739db293cf2ef2a4e6659f

   On Host 192.168.25.9:
   # ipsecadm new esp -spi 1001 -src 192.168.25.9 -dst 192.168.5.1
       -forcetunnel -enc blf -auth sha1 -key
       7762d8707255d974168cbb1d274f8bed4cbd3364 -authkey
       6a20367e21c66e5a40739db293cf2ef2a4e6659f
       # ipsecadm new esp -spi 1000 -dst 192.168.25.9 -src 192.168.5.1
       -forcetunnel -enc blf -auth sha1 -key
       7762d8707255d974168cbb1d274f8bed4cbd3364 -authkey
       6a20367e21c66e5a40739db293cf2ef2a4e6659f

   Notice that the SPIs are different. See [33]On the wire format for a
   complete description of what the SPI is and where it is used.

   Now that you have your Security Associations in place, set up your
   flows.

   Note that, with the -local option, ipsecadm will actually create two
   flows, one with the source address set to 0.0.0.0/32, which handles
   packets originating from the gateway.

   On 192.168.5.1:

   So, right here, two flows will be created, one with 0.0.0.0/32 as the
   source address, which covers all packets originating from the local
   host to the destination, as well as a flow from the destination back
   to the local host.
   # ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 192.168.25.9 -spi 1000 -addr
       192.168.5.1 255.255.255.255 192.168.25.9 255.255.255.255 -local

   On 192.168.25.9:
   # ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 192.168.5.1 -spi 1001 -addr
       192.168.25.9 255.255.255.255 192.168.5.1 255.255.255.255 -local

   If you want less overhead on your Host-to-Host VPNs, creating the SPI
   without -forcetunnel will let you use transport mode (whereas,
   -forcetunnel makes sure all of the IP packet, including the IP header,
   are encapsulated by SPI). If either the source or destination is a
   network, you will have to use tunnel mode. Creating an SA to and/or
   from a network will automatically ensure tunnel mode SPIs are being
   created.

   This is a simple way to start using IPSec.

   You can use IPSec to tunnel private IP address spaces over the
   Internet. Here is a good example... We want to tunnel 192.168.99.0/24,
   which is behind 208.1.1.1, to 208.1.2.0/24 and 208.1.5.0/24 which are
   behind 208.2.2.2. These examples were generated using the [34]rc.vpn
   script.

   As you can see, when you are using manual keying with IPSec, you have
   to specify exactly what you want done. It won't guess for you. Look at
   these examples...

On 208.1.1.1:

   First, set up the security associations (SAs):
   (This sets up the SPIs, encryption methods, and keys.)
   # ipsecadm new esp -src 208.1.1.1 -dst 208.2.2.2 -forcetunnel -spi
       1001 -enc blf -auth sha1 -key
       7762d8707255d974168cbb1d274f8bed4cbd3364 -authkey
       67e21c66e5a40739db293cf2ef2a4e6659f
       # ipsecadm new esp -src 208.2.2.2 -dst 208.1.1.1 -forcetunnel -spi
       1000 -enc blf -auth sha1 -key
       7762d8707255d974168cbb1d274f8bed4cbd3364 -authkey
       67e21c66e5a40739db293cf2ef2a4e6659f

   Next, setup a flow from 208.1.1.1 to 208.2.2.2
   # ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.2.2.2 -spi 1001 -addr 208.1.1.1
       255.255.255.255 208.2.2.2 255.255.255.255 -local

   Next, setup a flow from 208.1.2.0/24, which is behind 208.2.2.2, to
   192.168.99.0/24
   # ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.2.2.2 -spi 1001 -addr 192.168.99.0
       255.255.255.0 208.1.2.0 255.255.255.0

   Next, setup a flow from 208.1.5.0/24, which is behind 208.2.2.2, to
   192.168.99.0/24
   # ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.2.2.2 -spi 1001 -addr 192.168.99.0
       255.255.255.0 208.1.5.0 255.255.255.0

   Now, setup a flow from 208.1.2.0/24, which is behind 208.2.2.2 to the
   router 208.1.1.1.
   # ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.2.2.2 -spi 1001 -addr 208.1.1.1
       255.255.255.255 208.1.2.0 255.255.255.0 -local

   OK, setup a flow from 208.1.5.0/24, which is behind 208.2.2.2, to the
   router 208.1.1.1
   # ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.2.2.2 -spi 1001 -addr 208.1.1.1
       255.255.255.255 208.1.5.0 255.255.255.0 -local

   Finally, setup a flow from the router 208.2.2.2 to 192.168.99.0/24
   # ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.2.2.2 -spi 1001 -addr 192.168.99.0
       255.255.255.0 208.2.2.2 255.255.255.255

On 208.2.2.2:

   Same as before, we setup the SAs...
   # ipsecadm new esp -src 208.2.2.2 -dst 208.1.1.1 -forcetunnel -spi
       1000 -enc blf -auth sha1 -key
       7762d8707255d974168cbb1d274f8bed4cbd3364 -authkey
       67e21c66e5a40739db293cf2ef2a4e6659f
       # ipsecadm new esp -src 208.1.1.1 -dst 208.2.2.2 -forcetunnel -spi
       1001 -enc blf -auth sha1 -key
       7762d8707255d974168cbb1d274f8bed4cbd3364 -authkey
       67e21c66e5a40739db293cf2ef2a4e6659f

   Now, this is the reverse side... Setup a flow from the router
   208.2.2.2 to 208.1.1.1
   # ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.1.1.1 -spi 1000 -addr 208.2.2.2
       255.255.255.255 208.1.1.1 255.255.255.255 -local

   Setup a flow from the network 192.168.99.0/24, which is behind
   208.1.1.1, to 208.1.2.0/24
   # ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.1.1.1 -spi 1000 -addr 208.1.2.0
       255.255.255.0 192.168.99.0 255.255.255.0

   Setup a flow from the network 192.168.99.0/24, which is behind
   208.1.1.1, to 208.1.5.0/24
   # ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.1.1.1 -spi 1000 -addr 208.1.5.0
       255.255.255.0 192.168.99.0 255.255.255.0

   Now, setup a flow from 192.169.99.0/24, which is behind 208.1.1.1, to
   the router 208.2.2.2
   # ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.1.1.1 -spi 1000 -addr 208.2.2.2
       255.255.255.255 192.168.99.0 255.255.255.0 -local

   We're almost done... Two flows left to get 208.1.2.0/24 and
   208.1.5.0/24 from the router 208.2.2.2 to the router 208.1.1.1.
   # ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.1.1.1 -spi 1000 -addr 208.1.2.0
       255.255.255.0 208.2.2.2 255.255.255.255
       # ipsecadm flow -proto esp -dst 208.1.1.1 -spi 1000 -addr
       208.1.5.0 255.255.255.0 208.2.2.2 255.255.255.255

   If you have been using ipsecadm, and you want to get rid of any work
   that you've done, and start from scratch, do
   # ipsecadm flush

   This will flush all IPSec info (SPIs, flows, routing entries) from
   your system.

                  13.7 - How do I setup IPSec with photurisd?

   Photuris is not widely used and is still considered experimental as
   far as the RFC status is concerned. However, many people have used it
   with OpenBSD.

   To setup your photurisd, first edit /etc/photuris/secrets.conf on each
   host with photurisd.
bsd# cat /etc/photuris/secrets.conf
# Accepted keywords are:
# identity local "id" "secret"
# identity pair local "receivedid" "myid" "secret"
# identity remote "id" "secret"
# identity lookup "tag" username
# Simple
identity local "Default" "This should be changed."
identity remote "Default" "This should be changed."

   Change "This should be changed." to a key of your choice on the local
   config, and another key of your choice on the remote config. (Use the
   same config on your remote box but swap "local" and "remote" so that
   it sees itself as the local key.) Note that these keys will be
   replaced in a future version of photurisd that will carry out its
   initial key exchange with public keys.

   Make sure net.inet.ah.enable is set to 1.
bsd# sysctl -w net.inet.ah.enable=1
net.inet.ah.enable: 0 -> 1

   And run startkey.
bsd# startkey dst=remote.host

   Now, run tcpdump to verify that your packets are being encrypted with
   AH. (Run a ping in another window or session to generate traffic.)
   bsd# tcpdump proto ah

   You can also try using tcpdump by the host address if you aren't
   getting anything.
   bsd# tcpdump host remote.host

   You can make photurisd automatically set the source and destination
   host or networks in /etc/photuris/photuris.startup

                   13.8 - How do I setup IPSec with isakmpd?

   If you are thinking about VPNs or other traditional applications of
   IPSec, you probably are going to use ISAKMP. Some commercial
   implementations of IPSec do not provide any manual keying ability,
   instead they require you to use some form of ISAKMP.

  13.8.1 - What is isakmpd?

   ISAKMP (sometimes referred to as IKE, or Internet Key Exchange) is the
   key exchange mechanism for the VPN. It meets security concerns using
   the methods mentioned in RFC 2407, RFC 2408 and RFC 2409. ISAKMP
   manages the exchange of cryptographic keys that you would normally
   have to manage with [35]ipsecadm(8). It employs a two-phase process
   for establishing the IPSec parameters between two IPSec nodes.

   Phase 1 - The two ISAKMP peers establish a secure, authenticated
   channel upon which to communicate between two daemons. This
   establishes a Security Association (SA) between both hosts. Main Mode
   and Aggressive Mode are the methods used to establish this channel.
   Main Mode sends the various authentication information in a certain
   sequence, providing identity protection. Aggressive Mode does not
   provide identity protection because all of the authentication
   information is sent at the same time. Aggressive mode should only be
   used in such cases where network bandwidth is of concern.

   Phase 2 - Security Associations are negotiated on behalf of IPSec.
   Phase 2 is establishes tunnels or endpoint SA's between IPSec hosts.
   Quick Mode is used in Phase 2 because there is not need to repeat a
   full authentication because Phase 1 has already established the SAs.

   In brief, Phase 1 is used to get a secure channel in which to do the
   (quicker) phase 2 setups, there can be several. Phase 2 is used to
   setup the actual tunnels. In Phase 1, your IPSec nodes establish a
   connection where they exchange authentication (Either a X509
   certificate or a pre-shared secret). This allows each end to make sure
   the other end is authenticated. Phase 2 is an exchange of keys to
   determine how the data between the two will be encrypted.

  13.8.2 - How do I get started with isakmpd?

   By default, OpenBSD 2.6 comes with the proper binaries for ISAKMP and
   the IPSec stack. Unfotunately, the same cannot be said for the sample
   files. To retrieve them, you need to grab:
   /usr/src/sbin/isakmpd/samples/VPN-east.conf and
   /usr/src/sbin/isakmpd/samples/policy from the source tree. You can
   either use your CD (if you have one), [36]cvsweb, or the [37]command
   line CVS client. (Cvsweb has [38]VPN-east.conf and [39]policy readily
   available). For the purposes of this example, copy policy to
   /etc/isakmpd/policy. Copy VPN-east.conf to /etc/isakmpd/conf. Here we
   attempt to show you how to setup a VPN (tunnel). If you want to use
   isakmpd between single hosts, there are other configuration files in
   the samples directory.

   Your first step is to turn on esp. The [40]top of section 13.6 tells
   you how to do this both for run-time and boot. Next, you need to edit
   /etc/isakmpd/policy. This file tells ISAKMP who can access IPSec. In
   this scenario, the policy file states that anybody who sends data
   using Encapsulate Security Payload(ESP), and has authenticated with
   the passphrase mekmitasdigoat (or whatever passphrase you determine),
   is allowed to communicate with isakmpd. You can modify this file to
   let ISAKMP know that we only want to allow data signed with certain
   digital certificates or using a certain encryption transform. You
   could also allow anybody to access IPSec. This is only recommended for
   testing. To do this, edit your policy file to contain only the
   following lines:
KeyNote-Version: 2
Authoriser: "POLICY"

   The same policy file contains two lines that start with the $
   character. You need to remove these lines before using it, they are
   only for cvs.

   A more useful policy file for this example looks like this:
KeyNote-Version: 2
Comment: This policy accepts ESP SAs from a remote that uses the right password
Authoriser: "POLICY"
Licensees: "mekmitasdigoat"
Conditions: app_domain == "IPSec policy" &&
            esp_present == "yes" -> "true";

   This should be identical to the policy file included with OpenBSD 2.6.

   Implementing this will give you a basic VPN (tunnel) using ESP only.
   On host A, edit /etc/isakmpd/isakmpd.conf. The 249.2.2.2 sample IP
   address should be replaced with the external IP address of host A.
[General]
Retransmits=            5
Exchange-max-time=      120
Listen-on=              249.2.2.2

   Do similar for isakmpd.conf on host B. 249.3.3.3 represents the
   external IP address for host B.
[General]
Retransmits=            5
Exchange-max-time=      120
Listen-on=              249.3.3.3

   This is where you can setup the variables that will affect the main
   behaviour of isakmpd. It is okay to use the defaults here.
   The Listen-on= value specifies the IP that isakmpd should listen on.
   Only the Internet IP of your gateway is necessary. If you have
   multiple external interfaces on your gateway, you could list which
   interfaces you want to listening on by entering them using a comma
   separated list.

   Next, on host A, edit isakmpd.conf again.
[Phase 1]
249.3.3.3=              HostB

   On host B:
[Phase 1]
249.2.2.2=              HostA

   This section describes the IP addresses to accept in order to
   negotiate the phase 1 connection. Its value points to the section
   below (Remember that phase 1 simply authenticates the remote peer to
   make sure they are who they say they are). You can list multiple peers
   with additional lines in the format of IP_Address= <PEER-NAME>.

   Next, on host A:
[Phase 2]
Connections=            HostA-HostB

   On host B:
[Phase 2]
Connections=            HostB-HostA

   This describes Phase 2 of the connection. This is the phase that
   determines what protocols the two peers will use to communicate.

   The Connections= tag refers to the section below. It initiates the
   requirements or the accepted methods to set up Phase 2. This also
   tells ISAKMPD which connections to initiate once started. Note that
   you can have multiple sections as illustrated below if you are to
   connect with multiple peer hosts.

   If you do not have the IP address of the remote host, you can specify
   a Default= that points to a section describing a generic entry that
   will be referenced by any incoming IP that is not listed in the
   Connections= tag.

   On host A:
[HostB]
Phase=                  1
Transport=              udp
Local-address=          249.2.2.2
Address=                249.3.3.3
Configuration=          Default-main-mode
Authentication=         mekmitasdigoat
#Flags=

   On host B:
[HostA]
Phase=                  1
Transport=              udp
Local-address=          249.3.3.3
Address=                249.2.2.2
Configuration=          Default-main-mode
Authentication=         mekmitasdigoat
#Flags=

   These represent the sections referred to by the Phase 1 section above.
   They each describe the requirements that the peer gateway must fulfil
   in order to proceed to Phase 2. There are many other options here but
   the ones mentioned above are the minimum requirements.
   Phase=1 is required because the ISAKMPD code uses the same procedures
   to process Phase 1 and Phase 2. It must be 1 or nothing will work.
   Transport= is gives you different possibilities for different peers.
   It's suggested that udp be used here so we'll leave it at that.
   Please note that some peers may be behind a firewall that doesn't let
   UDP traffic through. Obviously, this needs to be determined before
   setup. Local-address is the destination address that the incoming
   packets point to. In some cases, you can be listening on different
   Interfaces for Phase 1 connections. In this example, there is only 1
   interface listening, therefore this is the IP of the listening
   interface on this peer.
   Address= is the address that points to the source IP of the incoming
   packets. This usually points to the peer gateway. This needs further
   explanation, because the source IP address of the peer may be unknown!
   Configuration= points to the section below. You can specify multiple
   sections like this. We use the default one specified by the sample
   file.
   Authentication= is the pre-shared secret to be used for this
   particular peer. It is more or less a passphrase that each peer uses.
   This passphrase gets passed to policy to verify whether this peer is
   allowed to use IPSEC with this host. If you change this phrase, you
   must also change it in the policy file because the sample file
   provides for this passphrase. If you decided to go with a minimum
   policy file then you can specify whatever you want here.
   Flags= is not currently being used. The RFCs leave room for extra
   options to be specified for phase 1.
   There are other tags here that will allow for other options to be set.
   Refer to [41]isakmpd.conf(5) for descriptions.

   On Host A:
[HostA-HostB]
Phase=                  2
ISAKMP-peer=            HostB
Configuration=          Default-quick-mode
Local-ID=               Net-A
Remote-ID=              Net-B

   On Host B:
[HostB-HostA]
Phase=                  2
ISAKMP-peer=            HostA
Configuration=          Default-quick-mode
Local-ID=               Net-B
Remote-ID=              Net-A

   These represent the sections referred to by the Phase 2 section above.
   They are the individual settings that ISAKMPD must use to talk between
   the two gateways for the particular connection. Phase=2 is required
   because ISAKMPD code uses the same functions to authenticate Phase 1
   and Phase 2. This is required for the VPN to work.
   ISAKMPD-Peer= is the name of Host section above. This means that we
   are talking to that particular peer to establish a Phase 2 connection.
   This is provided because you can have multiple sections to describe
   isakmp peers and connections. Configuration= refers to the section
   below that describes the standards by which this host and the
   particular peer for this connection must abide.
   Local-ID= refers to an IPSec-ID section below that describes our
   Private Network to the peer gateway. This is the portion that is
   passed so that the other gateway can set up the proper routing table
   that will transfer data over the VPN to our network.
   Remote-ID= refers to an IPSec-ID section below that describes what is
   supposed to be the remote Private Network to our host. This portion is
   interpreted to set up the proper routing tables that will transfer
   data from our Private Network over the VPN to the remote Private
   Network.
   There is another tag that is supported here called Flags=. If you
   require this tag, read [42]isakmpd.conf(5).

   This is the IPSec-ID section. These entries need to exist in the
   isakmpd.conf files for both Host A and Host B. This example will setup
   192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0 for Host A (which was connected to Net-A
   above) and 192.168.20.0/255.255.255.0 for Host B (Net-B above).
[Net-A]
ID-type=                IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET
Network=                192.168.1.0
Netmask=                255.255.255.0

[Net-B]
ID-type=                IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET
Network=                192.168.20.0
Netmask=                255.255.255.0

   These two sections are in the conf file of each host. They are the
   sections referenced by the Local-ID and Remote-ID identifiers. They
   describe the routes that should be set up to allow traffic from one
   private network to another.
   ID-type= can be IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET or IPV4_ADDR (RFC2708 mentions more
   possible values. Currently only IPv4 is supported in the OpenBSD 2.6
   implementation. IPv6 may be supported in OpenBSD-current. )

   Now, on both hosts, the sample file should read:
[Default-main-mode]
DOI=                    IPSEC
EXCHANGE_TYPE=          ID_PROT
Transforms=             3DES-SHA

   This section describes the requirements for the encryption methods of
   Phase 1 connections. The name reflects the value of Configuration=
   variable. As we can see here, we are stating our Domain of Interest
   which is IPSEC. The EXCHANGE_TYPE variable is set to ID_PROT for Phase
   1, which identifies the protocols to be covered by this
   Authentication.
   Transforms= is the transform required (or assigned) for this exchange.
   In this case, this points to the section below in the configuration
   file that says we are receiving a packet encrypted with 3DES and a
   checksum verifiable with SHA. There are a bunch of different
   transforms defined inside the sample VPN-east.conf. These are provided
   because 3DES and SHA are not always supported across different
   platforms. For OpenBSD there should be no reason to change this for a
   basic setup. Feel free to create multiples of this section and change
   the transform. The only requirement is that you change the
   Configuration= variable.
[Default-quick-mode]
DOI=                    IPSEC
EXCHANGE_TYPE=          QUICK_MODE
Suites=                 QM-ESP-3DES-SHA-PFS-SUITE,QM-ESP-DES-MD5-PFS-SUITE

   This section describes the requirements for the encryption of the data
   to be sent through the VPN and is referred to by Configuration above.
   Note the difference between this section and the Phase 1 equivalent
   just above is that the EXCHANGE_TYPE is QUICK_MODE. This is always the
   case for Phase 2.
   Suites= points to a IPSec Suite section describing the different
   encryption schemes available between the two hosts.
   There is much more to be said about ISAKMP and IPSec. By using the
   above basic descriptions you should be able to create a simple but
   solid VPN that cares and feeds itself. This is the bare minimum
   isakmpd.conf for both hosts here.

  13.8.3 - Starting isakmpd

   You may wish to use $ isakmpd -d -DA=99
   the first time you decide to run this daemon. The daemon will not be
   running in daemon mode but as a regular process. It will log
   everything to your terminal. To stop isakmpd and flush the routes, you
   need to kill the isakmpd process on each node, and run ipsecadm flush.

             13.9 - What IKE clients are compatible with isakmpd?

   isakmpd is the ISAKMP/Oakley key management daemon that comes with
   OpenBSD. We suspect that it interoperates, at least partially, with
   most any ISAKMP implementation, but the following have actually been
   tested. Note that some isakmp software out there is actually based on
   the OpenBSD isakmp daemon.

   The following MS-Windows clients have been reported to be compatible:
     * [43]TimeStep PERMIT/Client
     * [44]Ashley Laurent VPCom VPN software
     * [45]PGP VPN software
     * [46]Radguard cIPro client
     * [47]Cisco Win32 client (unreleased?)

   The following gateways/routers have been reported to be compatible:
     * [48]Cisco IOS
     * [49]Cisco PIX
     * [50]Intel LanRover
     * [51]TimeStep PERMIT/Gate
     * [52]Cendio Fuego
     * [53]KAME for FreeBSD
     * [54]FreeS/WAN for Linux
     * [55]Axent Raptor
     * [56]Ericsson eBox
     * [57]Radguard cIPro-VPN
     * [58]F-Secure VPN+
     * [59]Teamware TWISS
     * [60]3com Pathbuilder
     * [61]Nortel Contivity
     * [62]CheckPoint FW-1

                       13.10 - Troubleshooting IPSec/VPN

   Your first tool for troubleshooting IPSec is [63]tcpdump(8). Use
   tcpdump to look for several things.

   First, if you are running OpenBSD 2.6, you have an enhanced version of
   tcpdump which can show some information about ESP and AH packets. If
   you are using tcpdump from OpenBSD 2.5 or on another operating system,
   chances are you have an older version that will simply show the
   protocol number for AH or ESP if it sees either kind of packets on
   your network. (ESP is IP protocol 50, AH is 51)
     * With tcpdump, look and see if traffic is using AH/ESP or
       cleartext. If your traffic is in cleartext, then your flows are
       setup incorrectly or your isakmp is not negotiating properly. Use
       [64]ping(8) to generate simple traffic.
        For instance, I have two hosts, 208.1.1.1 and 208.2.2.2. Logged
            in to 208.2.2.2, I am doing this:

     * With tcpdump on OpenBSD, you can decode most cleartext parts of
       Internet Key Exchange sessions. If you are using tcpdump from a
       version of OpenBSD that is newer then 2.6-RELEASE, tcpdump will
       also show AH payload data. If you are interested in a patch to do
       this for an older version of tcpdump, contact [65]ho@openbsd.org.

       In /kern, there is a table of current SA/SPIs, including which
       have flows (outgoing SAs) or not (incoming SAs). There are also
       traffic counters which you can use to see what traffic going
       where.
     * Finally, you can use [66]netstat(1) to see your SAs.

Using OpenBSD's Disklabel

     * [10]Disklabel during the OpenBSD install
     * [11]Common disklabel(8) uses.

  What is disklabel(8)?

   Disklabel's are created to allow an efficient interface between your
   disk and the disk drivers contained within the kernel. Labels hold
   certain information about your disk, like your drive geometry and
   information about your filesystems. This is then used by the bootstrap
   program to load the drive and to know where filesystems are contained
   on the drive. Labels are also used in conjunction with the filesystems
   to create a more efficient environment. You can read more in-depth
   information about disklabel by reading the [12]disklabel(5) man page.

   As an additional gain, using disklabel helps overcome architecture
   limitations on disk partitioning. For example, on i386, you can only
   have 4 primary partitions. (Partitions that other operating systems,
   such as Windows NT or DOS can see.) With disklabel(8), you use one of
   these 'primary' partitions to store *all* of your OpenBSD partitions
   (eg. 'swap', '/', '/usr' and '/var'). And you still have 3 more
   partitions available for other OSs!

  disklabel(8) during OpenBSD's install

   One of the major parts of OpenBSD's install is your initial creation
   of labels. This comes (for i386 users) directly after using
   [13]fdisk(1). During the install you use disklabel to create your
   separate labels which will contain your separate mountpoints. During
   the install, you can set your mountpoints from within disklabel(8),
   but this isn't completely necessary considering you will be prompted
   later to confirm you choices. But it does make your install go just a
   little smoother.

   Since this is during the install you won't have any existing labels,
   and they will need to be created. The first label you will create is
   the label 'a'. This label SHOULD be your where / will be mounted. You
   can see recommended partitions that should be created and their sizes
   by reading [14]faq4.3. For servers it is recommended that you create
   at least these label's separately. For desktop users creating one
   mountpoint at / will probobly suffice. When initially creating your
   root partition ( 'a' label ), keep in mind that you will need SOME
   space left for your swap label. Now that the basics have been
   explained, here is an example of using disklabel during an install. In
   this first example it is assumed that OpenBSD will be the only
   operating system on this computer, and that a full install will be
   done.

If this disk is shared with other operating systems, those operating systems
should have a BIOS partition entry that spans the space they occupy completely.
For safety, also make sure all OpenBSD file systems are within the offset and
size specified in the 'A6' BIOS partition table.  (By default, the disklabel
editor will try to enforce this).  If you are unsure of how to use multiple
partitions properly (ie. seperating /,  /usr, /tmp, /var, /usr/local, and other
things) just split the space into a root and swap partition for now.

# using MBR partition 3: type A6 off 63 (0x3f) size 4991553 (0x4c2a41)

Treating sectors 63-16386300 as the OpenBSD portion of the disk.
You can use the 'b' command to change this.

Initial label editor (enter '?' for help at any prompt)
> d a
> a a
offset: [63] <Enter>
size: [16386237] 64M
Rounding to nearest cylinder: 131040
FS type: [4.2BSD] <Enter>
mount point: [none] /
fragment size: [1024] <Enter>
block size: [8192] <Enter>
cpg: [16] <Enter>
> a b
offset: [131103] <Enter>
size: [16255197] 64M
Rounding to nearest cylinder: 131040
FS type: [swap] <Enter>

   At this point we have created a 64M root partition mounted at /, and a
   64Meg swap partition. Notice that the offset starts at sector 63. This
   is what you want. When it comes to the size, disklabel will show your
   size in sectors, however, you don't need to enter sizes in the same
   format. Like the example above you can enter sizes in the manner of 64
   Megabytes = 64M and 2 Gigabytes = 2G. Disklabel will then round to the
   nearest cylinder. In the example above you will also notice that
   disklabel assumes that label 'b' will be a swap. This is a correct
   assumption as the GENERIC kernel is set to look for swap on label 'b',
   and you should just follow this guideline and use 'b' as your swap
   area.

   The next example will take you through the creation of two more
   labels. This means that it's not a complete install, as the size of
   these won't be enough to install OpenBSD to its fullest. Showing the
   creation of all the partitions would just be repetitive.
> a d
offset: [262143] <Enter>
size: [16124157] 64M
Rounding to nearest cylinder: 131040
FS type: [4.2BSD] <Enter>
mount point: [none] /tmp
fragment size: [1024] <Enter>
block size: [8192] <Enter>
cpg: [16] <Enter>
> a e
offset: [393183] <Enter>
size: [15993117] 64M
Rounding to nearest cylinder: 131040
FS type: [4.2BSD] <Enter>
mount point: [none] /var
fragment size: [1024] <Enter>
block size: [8192] <Enter>
cpg: [16] <Enter>

   In the above example, there are two things you might notice. One being
   that the offset is automatically figured out for you to be the next in
   order. When doing an install of this sort, you won't need to mess with
   changing the offsets at all. Another difference you might notice will
   be that label 'c' has been skipped. This is done for a reason, which
   is that label 'c' is a label that represents the whole disk. For this
   reason you shouldn't deal with label 'c' in any way.

   Once all your labels have been created all thats left to do is write
   the labels to disk, and move on in the installation process. To write
   everything and quit disklabel (and continue with the install) do:
> w
> q

   *NOTE* - For user's with large drives. If your bios isn't able to
   support a drive of that size OpenBSD cannot support it either.
   Otherwise OpenBSD should be able to handle your drive just fine. If
   you are in a situation where your bios doesn't support your drive, you
   can try Maxtor EZ-Drive or other similar overlay product.

  Common uses for disklabel(8)

   Once your system is installed, you shouldn't need to use disklabel too
   often. But some times you will need to use disklabel are when adding,
   removing or restructuring your disks. One of the first things you will
   need to do is view your current disklabel. To do this simply type:
# disklabel wd0 <----- Or whatever disk device you'd like to view

# using MBR partition 3: type A6 off 64 (0x40) size 16777152 (0xffffc0)
# /dev/rwd0c:

   The above command simply allows you to view the existing disklabel,
   and assuring that you dont mess anything up. ( Which we all need
   sometimes. ) But to be able to make changes you must use the -E option
   with disklabel like so:
# disklabel -E wd0

   This will bring you to a prompt, the same as the one that you used
   during the OpenBSD install. Probobly the single most important command
   at this prompt is '?'. This will give you a list of possible options
   pertaining to disklabel. You can even view the entire disklabel(8) man
   page with the 'M' command. From this prompt, you will do all of your
   adding, deleting and changing of partitions. For additional
   information read the [15]disklabel(8) man page.

14.2 - Using fdisk

   First be sure to check the fdisk main page. [16]fdisk(8)

   Fdisk is a program to help with the maintenance of your partitions.
   This program is used at install time to set up your OpenBSD partition
   (this partition can contain several labels, each with
   filesystems/swap/etc.). It can divide space on your drives and set one
   active. This program will usually be used in Single User Mode ( boot
   -s ). Fdisk also sets the MBR on your various hard disks.

   For installation purposes, most times you'll only need ONE OpenBSD
   partition, and then using disklabel to put a swap and a filesystem on
   it.

   To just view your partition table using fdisk just use:
# fdisk fd0

   Which will give an output similar to this:
         Disk: fd0       geometry: 80/2/18 [2880 sectors]
         Offset: 0       Signatures: 0xAA55,0x0
                  Starting        Ending
          #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
         *0: A6    0   0   1 -   79   1  18 [         0 -       2880] OpenBSD
          1: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused
          2: A7    0   0   2 -   79   1  18 [         1 -       2879] NEXTSTEP
          3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused

   In this example we are viewing the fdisk output of floppy drive. We
   can see the OpenBSD partition (A6) and its size. The * tells us that
   the OpenBSD partition is a bootable partition.

   In the previous example we just viewed our information. What if we
   want to edit our partition table? Well, to do so we must use the -e
   flag. This will bring up a command line prompt to interact with fdisk.
# fdisk -e wd0
Enter 'help' for information
fdisk: 1> help
        help            Command help list
        manual          Show entire OpenBSD man page for fdisk
        reinit          Re-initialize loaded MBR (to defaults)
        disk            Edit current drive stats
        edit            Edit given table entry
        flag            Flag given table entry as bootable
        update          Update machine code in loaded MBR
        select          Select extended partition table entry MBR
        print           Print loaded MBR partition table
        write           Write loaded MBR to disk
        exit            Exit edit of current MBR, without saving changes
        quit            Quit edit of current MBR, saving current changes
        abort           Abort program without saving current changes
fdisk: 1>

   It is perfectly safe in fdisk to go in and explore, just make sure to
   answer N to saving the changes and *DON'T* use the write command.

   Here is an overview of the commands you can use when you choose the -e
   flag.
     * help Display a list of commands that fdisk understands in the
       interactive edit mode.
     * reinit Initialize the currently selected, in-memory copy of the
       boot block.
     * disk Display the current drive geometry that fdisk has probed. You
       are given a chance to edit it if you wish.
     * edit Edit a given table entry in the memory copy of the current
       boot block. You may edit either in BIOS geometry mode, or in
       sector offsets and sizes.
     * flag Make the given partition table entry bootable. Only one entry
       can be marked bootable. If you wish to boot from an extended
       partition, you will need to mark the partition table entry for the
       extended partition as bootable.
     * update Update the machine code in the memory copy of the currently
       selected boot block.
     * select Select and load into memory the boot block pointed to by
       the extended partition table entry in the current boot block.
     * print Print the currently selected in-memory copy of the boot
       block and its MBR table to the terminal.
     * write Write the in-memory copy of the boot block to disk. You will
       be asked to confirm this operation.
     * exit Exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to the
       previously selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the
       program if there is none.
     * quit Exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to the
       previously selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the
       program if there is none. Unlike exit it does write the modified
       block out.
     * abort Quit program without saving current changes.

14.3 - Adding extra disks in OpenBSD

   Well once you get your disk installed PROPERLY you need to use
   [17]fdisk(8) (i386 only) and [18]disklabel(8) to set up your disk in
   OpenBSD.

   For i386 folks, start with fdisk. Other architectures can ignore this.
# fdisk -i sd2

   This will initialize the disk's "real" partition table for exclusive
   use by OpenBSD. Next you need to create a disklabel for it. This will
   seem confusing.
# disklabel -e sd2

(screen goes blank, your $EDITOR comes up)
type: SCSI
...bla...
sectors/track: 63
total sectors: 6185088
...bla...
16 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
  c:  6185088        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    0 - 6135)
  d:  1405080       63    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.    0*- 1393*)
  e:  4779945  1405143    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl. 1393*- 6135)

   First, ignore the 'c' partition, it's always there and is for programs
   like disklabel to function! For normal operations, fsize should always
   be 1024, bsize should always be 8192, and cpg should always be 16.
   Fstype is 4.2BSD. Total sectors is the total size of the disk. Say
   this is a 3 gigabyte disk. Three gigabytes in disk manufacturer terms
   is 3000 megabytes. So divide 6185088/3000 (use bc(1)). You get 2061.
   So to make up partition sizes for a, d, e, f, g, ... just multiply
   X*2061 to get X megabytes of space on that partition. The offset for
   your first new partition should be the same as the "sectors/track"
   reported earlier in disklabel's output. For us it is 63. The offset
   for each partition afterwards should be a combination of the size of
   each partition and the offset of each partition (Except the C
   partition, since it has no play into this equation.)

   Or, if you just want one partition on the disk, say you will use the
   whole thing for web storage or a home directory or something, just
   take the total size of the disk and subtract the sectors per track
   from it. 6185088-63 = 6185025. Your partition is
    d:  6185025       63    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16

   If all this seems needlessly complex, you can just use disklabel -E to
   get the same partitioning mode that you got on your install disk!
   There, you can just use "96M" to specify "96 megabytes". (Or, if you
   have a disk big enough, 96G for 96 gigs!) Unfortunately, the -E mode
   uses the BIOS disk geometry, not the real disk geometry, and often
   times the two are not the same. To get around this limitation, type 'g
   d' for 'geometry disk'. (Other options are 'g b' for 'geometry bios'
   and 'g u' for geometry user, or simply, what the label said before
   disklabel made any changes.)

   That was a lot. But you are not finished. Finally, you need to create
   the filesystem on that disk using [19]newfs(8).

bsd# newfs wd1a

   Or whatever your disk was named as per OpenBSD's disk numbering
   scheme. (Look at the output from dmesg(1) to see what your disk was
   named by OpenBSD.)

   Now figure out where you are going to mount this new partition you
   just created. Say you want to put it on /u. First, make the directory
   /u. Then, mount it.
mount /dev/wd1a /u

   Finally, add it to /etc/fstab
/dev/wd1a /u ffs rw 1 1

   What if you need to migrate an existing directory like /usr/local? You
   should mount the new drive in /mnt and use cpio -pdum to copy
   /usr/local to the /mnt directory. Edit the /etc/fstab file to show
   that the /usr/local partition is now /dev/wd1a (your freshly formatted
   partition.) Example:
   /dev/wd1a /usr/local ffs rw 1 1

   Reboot into single user mode..boot -s Move the existing /usr/local to
   /usr/local-backup (or delete it if you feel lucky) and create an empty
   directory /usr/local. Then reboot the system, and whala!! the files
   are there!

14.4 - How to swap to a file

   (Note: if you are looking to swap to a file because you are getting
   "virtual memory exhausted" errors, you should try raising the
   per-process limits first with csh's [20]unlimit(1), or sh's
   [21]ulimit(1).)

   After the release of OpenBSD 2.5 came [22]swapctl(8), which made
   dealing with swap devices much easier. If you are on an OpenBSD 2.5
   system, exchange swapctl with swapon, and use pstat -s to list swap
   devices. Swapping to a file doesn't require a custom built kernel,
   although that can still be done, this faq will show you how to add
   swap space both ways.

  Swapping to a file.

   Swapping to a file is easiest and quickest way to get extra swap
   area's setup. This is not for users who are currently using
   Softupdates. (Which isn't enabled by default). To start out, you can
   see how much swap you are currently have and how much you are using
   with the [23]swapctl(8) utility. You can do this by using the command:
ericj@oshibana> swapctl -l
Device      512-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Priority
swap_device      65520        8    65512     0%    0

   This shows the devices currently being used for swapping and their
   current statistics. In the above example there is only one device
   named "swap_device". This is the predefined area on disk that is used
   for swapping. (Shows up as partition b when viewing disklabels) As you
   can also see in the above example, that device isn't getting much use
   at the moment. But for the purposes of this document, we will act as
   if an extra 32M is needed.

   The first step to setting up a file as a swap device is to create the
   file. It's best to do this with the [24]dd(1) utility. Here is an
   example of creating the file /var/swap that is 32M large.
ericj@oshibana> sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap bs=1k count=32768
32768+0 records in
32768+0 records out
33554432 bytes transferred in 20 secs (1677721 bytes/sec)

   Once this has been done, we can turn on swapping to that device. Use
   the following command to turn on swapping to this device
ericj@oshibana> sudo swapctl -a /var/swap

   Now we need to check to see if it has been correctly added to the list
   of our swap devices.
ericj@oshibana> swapctl -l
Device      512-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Priority
swap_device      65520        8    65512     0%    0
/var/swap        65536        0    65536     0%    0
Total           131056        8   131048     0%

   Now that the file is setup and swapping is being done, you need to add
   a line to your /etc/fstab file so that this file is configured on the
   next boot time also. If this line is not added, your won't have this
   swap device configured.
ericj@oshibana> cat /etc/fstab
/dev/wd0a / ffs rw 1 1
/var/swap /var/swap sw 0 0

  Swapping via a vnode device

   This is a more permanent solution to adding more swap space. To swap
   to a file permanently, first make a kernel with vnd0c as swap. If you
   have wd0a as root filesystem, wd0b is the previous swap, use this line
   in the kernel configuration file (refer to compiling a new kernel if
   in doubt):
config          bsd     root on wd0a swap on wd0b and vnd0c dumps on wd0b

   After this is done, the file which will be used for swapping needs to
   be created. You should do this by using the same command as in the
   above examples.
ericj@oshibana> sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap bs=1k count=32768
32768+0 records in
32768+0 records out
33554432 bytes transferred in 20 secs (1677721 bytes/sec)

   Now your file is in place, you need to add the file to you /etc/fstab.
   Here is a sample line to boot with this device as swap on boot.
ericj@oshibana> cat /etc/fstab
/dev/wd0a / ffs rw 1 1
/dev/vnd0c none swap sw 0 0

   At this point your computer needs to be rebooted so that the kernel
   changes can take place. Once this has been done it's time to configure
   the device as swap. To do this you will use [25]vnconfig(1).
ericj@oshibana> sudo vnconfig -c -v vnd0 /var/swap
vnd0: 33554432 bytes on /var/swap

   Now for the last step, turning on swapping to that device. We will do
   this just like in the above examples, using swapctl(8). Then we will
   check to see if it was correctly added to our list of swap devices.
ericj@oshibana> sudo swapctl -a /dev/vnd0c
ericj@oshibana> swapctl -l
Device      512-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Priority
swap_device      65520        8    65512     0%    0
/dev/vnd0c       65536        0    65536     0%    0
Total           131056        8   131048     0%

14.5 - Soft-updates

   Softupdates are experimental and are NOT recomended for regular users.

   Over the last few years Kirk McKusick has been working on something
   called "soft updates". This is based on an idea proposed by Greg
   Ganger and Yale Patt that imposing a partial ordering on the buffer
   cache opertions would permit the requirement for synchronous writing
   of directory entries to be removed from the FFS code. Thus, a large
   performance increase of disk writing performance.

   To enable Softupdates your kernel must have option

   option FFS_SOFTUPDATES

   then you need to boot into single-user mode:
        boot>boot -s
        [snip]
        bsd# tunefs -s enable <raw device>
        bsd# reboot -n

   GOOD LUCK. Please direct all problem reports with as MUCH information
   as possible (kernel coredumps, tracebacks, etc) to [26]Costa. Do not
   waste his time with any other questions or incomplete problem reports.

14.6 - When I boot after installation of OpenBSD/i386, it stops at "Using
partition 3 id 0".

   This means that your MBR (Master Boot Record) was not installed
   properly or that your BIOS' idea of the hard disk geometry is not
   compatible with your current MBR. To solve this, first try to
   reinstall the OpenBSD boot blocks. To do so use [27]fdisk(8) and
   [28]installboot(8).

   First, to get up and running, you will need to use your boot disk as a
   bootstrap. After you put the install disk in, and before it loads the
   kernel and ramdisk, you get a boot> prompt from the floppy disk. Use
   it to boot OpenBSD off of your hard disk.
booting...
OpenBSD boot 1.2.3
probing hd0 fd0...
boot> boot hd0a:/bsd

   Now that you are booted, and assuming you have dedicated your entire
   hard disk to OpenBSD, re-initialize the Master Boot Record with
   fdisk(8). (If you have partitions on your hard disk for operating
   systems other then OpenBSD, you cannot use installboot anyways, you
   must look at another option such as OS-BS, described below.)
# fdisk -i wd0

   Now, you need to write the boot blocks again.
# cp /usr/mdec/boot /boot
# /usr/mdec/installboot -v /boot /usr/mdec/biosboot wd0

   Finally, reboot and test it out.

   If this doesn't work you still have a few more options. So, luck
   hasn't run out yet. The first is to use a bootloader such as OS-BS.
   The OpenBSD cd has the os-bs bootloader included in the tools
   directory. If you didn't purchase a CD-ROM, you can download os-bs
   from any of the OpenBSD ftp sites. The file to grab is
   pub/OpenBSD/2.6/tools/osbs135.exe

   Also, take some time to look through the OS-BS web pages at
   [29]http://www.prz.tu-berlin.de/~wolf/os-bs.html

   There are also other commercial bootloaders or lilo that you can use
   for multi-booting.

   Here is a simple outline of how to get lilo onto your system.

     * Boot a DOS floppy and do a fdisk /MBR. Make sure you do that on
       the drive you'll be booting from.
     * Boot from a linux disk and install LILO & chain it to your OpenBSD
       boot block.

   For further instructions read [30]INSTALL.linux

14.7 - How do I get a dmesg from a boot floppy?

   RAMDISK images (boot floppies) do not ship with the dmesg utility.
   They do, however, have the /kern filesystem mounted. To copy the dmesg
   information to a file, do a:
   # cat /kern/msgbuf >mydmesg

   Boot disks also have 'more' to page through the output:
   # more /kern/msgbuf

   Also check with [31]section 4.5

14.8 - Installing Bootblocks - i386 specific

   Older versions of MS-DOS can only deal with disk geometries of 1024
   cylinders or less. Since virtually all modern disks have more than
   1024 cylinders, most SCSI BIOS chips (which come on the SCSI
   controller card) and IDE BIOS (which is part of the rest of the PC
   BIOS) have an option (sometimes the default) to "translate" the real
   disk geometry into something that fits within MS-DOS' ability.
   However, not all BIOS chips "translate" the geometry in the same way.
   If you change your BIOS (either with a new motherboard or a new SCSI
   controller), and the new one uses a different "translated" geometry,
   you will be unable to load the second stage boot loader (and thus
   unable to load the kernel). (This is because the first stage boot
   loader contains a list of the blocks that comprise /boot in terms of
   the original "translated" geometry.) If you are using IDE disks, and
   you make changes to your BIOS settings, you can (unknowingly) change
   its translation also (most IDE BIOS offer 3 different translations.)
   To fix your boot block so that you can boot normally, just put a boot
   floppy in your hard drive, and at the boot prompt, type "b hd0a:/bsd"
   to force it to boot from the first hard disk (and not the floppy).
   Your machine should come up normally. You now need to update the first
   stage boot loader to see the new geometry (and re-write the boot block
   accordingly).
   Our example will assume your boot disk is sd0 (but for IDE it would be
   wd0, etc..):
# cd /usr/mdec; ./installboot /boot biosboot sd0

   If installboot complains that it is unable to read the BIOS geometry,
   at the boot> prompt you may issue the "machine diskinfo" (or "ma di"
   for short) command to print the information you need. Feed the "heads"
   and "secs" values to installboot's -h and -s flags, respectively, so
   that the modified installboot command is the following:
# cd /usr/mdec; ./installboot -h <heads> -s <secs> /boot biosboot sd0

   If a newer version of bootblocks are required, you will need to
   compile these yourself. To do so simply.
# cd /sys/arch/i386/stand/
# make && make install
# cd /usr/mdec; cp ./boot /boot
# ./installboot /boot biosboot sd0 (or whatever device your hard disk is)

                           _____________________

  1.0: General Upgrade Questions

    1.1: Terminology. What is -current? What are Snapshots?

   Unlike Operating System projects like Linux and FreeBSD, OpenBSD
   development happens from a single, unbranched source tree. On
   approximately six-month intervals, OpenBSD releases are produced.
   These are numbered in the conventional (2.x) manner. The current
   OpenBSD release is 2.6.

   -current, short for openbsd-current, refers to the up-to-the-minute
   version of the source tree contained in the CVS repository. This is
   the tree most commonly used by OpenBSD developers. The -current tree
   contains all the code that is planned for the next release. From time
   to time, brave souls will abandon the formal releases and run
   openbsd-current, usually to take advantage of features that have not
   yet made it into the formal releases. Because of its uncertain nature,
   however, upgrading to -current is not recommended for non-technical
   users.

   Between formal releases, a series of snapshot releases are [29]made
   available. Snapshots are test releases of the -current source tree.
   Because they reflect the current state of development, there is no
   guarantee that snapshot releases will work correctly (or even at all).
   Snapshots are quite useful when moving from a formal release (or older
   version of -current) to the current tree.

    1.2: What is the best way to upgrade to -current?

   Due to changes in the underlying libraries, moving directly from a
   release to -current is not always easy. The most painless way to move
   up to -current is to first upgrade to the latest snapshot (usually,
   via an FTP install). Once the snapshot is installed, the latest source
   can be [30]fetched and [31]built. This procedure should eliminate most
   toolchain and library problems.

    1.3: I looked, but didn't see any snapshots on the FTP site. Where did they
    go?

   The snapshots used to be taken temporarily offline right around the
   release time of a new version. This is no longer the OpenBSD policy.

   Snapshots may be removed as they become old (or no longer relevant).
   If no snapshot is available, you should upgrade to the most recent
   release and build the remainder of the way from source.

    1.4: How do I get the latest source?

   Short answer: [32]http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html

   For example. To retrieve the entire tree via CVS: (using the bash
   shell. Others substitute setenv for export)
# export CVSROOT=anoncvs@anoncvs.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs
# export CVS_RSH=/usr/local/bin/ssh
# cd /usr
# cvs -q get -PA src

    1.5: Okay, I have the tree. How do I build it.

   Basic instructions are in /usr/src/Makefile. This is a slightly
   expanded version.

1. Clean out the old object files.

If you created a separate /usr/obj directory, clean that, and
rebuild the symbolic links:

# rm -rf /usr/obj
# mkdir /usr/obj
# cd /usr/src
# make obj

If you're worried there are object files in your source tree,
do this:

# cd /usr/src
# find . -type l -name obj | xargs rm
# make cleandir
# rm -rf /usr/obj
# mkdir /usr/obj
# make obj

2. Perform any verion-specific configuration changes. For example,
2.3 users must add the named user and group before
moving to 2.4 or later. See the specific Mini-FAQ section for
your version.

3. Make sure all the appropriate directories are created. This
is especially important when upgrading from older versions, but is
sometimes necessary in other cases. The easiest way to do this is:

# cd /usr/src/etc && make DESTDIR=/ distrib-dirs

4. Compile a new kernel.

# cd /usr/src/sys/arch/`machine`/conf
# cp GENERIC MYKERNEL
# vi MYKERNEL
(edit MYKERNEL to your liking)
# config MYKERNEL
# cd ../compile/MYKERNEL
# make clean && make depend && make
(arc architecture only) copy bsd.ecoff to your FAT partition
# cp /bsd /bsd.old && cp bsd /bsd
# chown root.wheel /bsd (if you compiled as someone else)
(reboot)

5. Compile the system.

# cd /usr/src
# make build

6. Update /etc and /dev by hand. These are not updated
automatically. Choose a directory with enough space to
hold /, /dev, /var, and /etc. Here I'll use /home/newroot
(Note: make sure the directory hierarchy you choose
does not have group write (g+w) or other write (o+w)
permissions or sendmail will complain during this step.
This makes /tmp a bad choice):

# mkdir /home/newroot
# export DESTDIR=/home/newroot
# cd /usr/src/etc && make distribution-etc-root-var

Now compare the files in /home/newroot with their
installed counterparts. Replace or update the files as
necessary.

# rm -rf /home/newroot   (when done)

7. Reboot to make sure the new /etc files are correct

    1.6: My make build stopped halfway. Do I have to redo the whole thing?

   I would, but if you really want to pick up where you left off, do a:
# cd /usr/src
# make -n build

   This will show you what make build is doing. For example, mine tells
   me:
(cd /usr/src/share/mk &&  make install)
(cd /usr/src/include;  make includes)
make cleandir
(cd /usr/src/lib && make depend && make &&   make install)
(cd /usr/src/gnu/lib && make depend && make &&   make install)
(cd /usr/src/kerberosIV && make build)
make depend && make &&  make install

   To pick up where you left off, just reissue the commands from the
   point where the compile died.

   If you do this procedure a lot, you may want to create a new target in
   your makefile. Simply copy the entry for build (to build-noclean, for
   example), and remove the make cleandir reference.

  2.0: Upgrading from 2.3

    2.1: What are the major problems upgrading from 2.3 to 2.4?

    New User: named

   After 2.3, the named DNS daemon was moved to a chroot jail. To make
   this change possible, the named user was created. If you do not have
   it already, you will need to create this user to ensure that all
   directories get created properly during the build process.

   Add the following entry to /etc/passwd using vipw
named:*:70:70::0:0:BIND Daemon:/var/named:/sbin/nologin

   Add the following to /etc/group:
named:*:70:

    2.2: I tried the build, but it failed when trying to compile ssleay.

   You are likely missing an entry for the named user in your password
   file.

   Short Answer:

   Create this user prior to the build.

   Long Answer:

   The named user is required in order to set permissions correctly. If
   this user is missing, part of the build process fails. If you capture
   your build to a file (say, with a make build &>/tmp/build.log) you
   will notice the following message:
(cd /usr/src/etc && make DESTDIR=/ distrib-dirs)
install -d -o root -g wheel -m 755 /
mtree -def mtree/4.4BSD.dist -p // -u

mtree: unknown user named
mtree: failed at line 1632 of the specification
*** Error code 1 (ignored)

   Unfortunately for us, the build continued happily on its way, totally
   ignoring the fact that an error occurred.

   If the named user exists, mtree works properly:
missing: ./var/named (created)
missing: ./var/named/dev (created)
missing: ./var/named/etc (created)
missing: ./etc/afs (created)
missing: ./etc/ssl (created)
missing: ./etc/ssl/private (created)
missing: ./usr/obj (not created: File exists)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/html (created)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/html/lynx_help (created)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/html/lynx_help/keystrokes (created)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/usd/13.viref (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/cat4/powerpc (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/man4/alpha (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/man4/pmax (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/man4/powerpc (created)
missing: ./usr/share/tmac/mdoc (created)
missing: ./var/www/htdocs/manual/vhosts (created)
missing: ./usr/include/ssl (created)

   The reason for the fail, then, is that the /usr/include/ssl directory
   was never created. Without the header files, the ssleay build fails.

   Fix:

   Create the named user and group. Remove /usr/include/ssl, /var/named,
   and any other directory from the list above that was mistakenly
   created as a normal file by the make build.

    2.3: I tried the build, but it failed when trying to make something for the
    PowerPC.

   Your directory tree is incomplete. Specifically, the
   /usr/share/man/cat4/powerpc directory is missing.

   Quick Fix:

   Create this directory and proceed with the compilation

   Complete Fix:

   Create the entire directory tree. Do a:
# cd /usr/src/etc && make DESTDIR=/ distrib-dirs

   You will likely see an output like the following:
install -d -o root -g wheel -m 755 /
mtree -def mtree/4.4BSD.dist -p // -u

missing: ./var/named (created)
missing: ./var/named/dev (created)
missing: ./var/named/etc (created)
missing: ./etc/afs (created)
missing: ./etc/ssl (created)
missing: ./etc/ssl/private (created)
missing: ./usr/obj (not created: File exists)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/html (created)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/html/lynx_help (created)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/html/lynx_help/keystrokes (created)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/usd/13.viref (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/cat4/powerpc (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/man4/alpha (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/man4/pmax (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/man4/powerpc (created)
missing: ./usr/share/tmac/mdoc (created)
missing: ./var/www/htdocs/manual/vhosts (created)
missing: ./usr/include/ssl (created)

   Note that /usr/share/man/cat4/powerpc was one of the directories
   created by this process.

  3.0: Upgrading from 2.4

    3.1: What are the major problems upgrading from 2.4 to 2.5?

    cap_mkdb

   The syntax for invoking cap_mkdb has changed slightly. Before doing a
   make build, rebuild cap_mkdb from the latest source:
# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/cap_mkdb
# make clean && make && make install

   The make build should then run to completion

    Man Page Changes

   Several man pages were moved from section 1 to later sections
   Unfortunately, if the old man pages are left in section 1, unwary
   users will not see the latest version of the page.

   The following pages should be removed:
/usr/share/man/cat1/ipf.0
/usr/share/man/cat1/ipnat.0
/usr/share/man/cat1/ipsecadm.0

    Snake

   You will need to remove the contents of the obj directory before
   upgrading /usr/src/games/snake.

    3.2: I tried the build, but it failed on cap_mkdb.

   Symptom:

   A make build resulted in an error like this:
cap_mkdb -i -f terminfo terminfo.src
cap_mkdb: illegal option -- i
usage: cap_mkdb [-v] [-f outfile] file1 [file2 ...]
*** Error code 1

   Quick Fix:

   You need to build a new cap_mkdb. See [33]3.1.

  4.0: Upgrading from 2.5

    4.1: What are the major problems upgrading from 2.5 to 2.6?

      perl and make

   The latest version of Perl (5.005_03) requires a new version of make
   to compile properly. You must rebuild make before building the new
   Perl. Do a:
# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/make
# make clean && make && make install

   Then go ahead and rebuild the new Perl. You will need to clean out the
   Perl obj directory by hand before building.

   Perl developers should take note of the latest changes. From
   millert@openbsd.org:
The version of perl in the OpenBSD source tree (post 2.5) has been
upgraded to 5.005_03.  The build method has changed somewhat but
most of that should be invisible.  The important changes that affect
people are as follows:

1) Perl lib files have moved from /usr/lib/perl5 to the more correct
/usr/libdata/perl5
2) The default site_perl directories now live in /usr/local.  Ie:
if you install a perl module, it will place itself in
/usr/local/libdata/perl5/site_lib.  This makes it easy to
see what non-stock modules you have.  It also means that we
can have perl modules in the ports system easily.
3) The perl library man pages are now install in /usr/share/man/cat3p
You'll need to update your man.conf based on the src/etc/man.conf
to take advantage of them.  This means you can now do
"man 3p less" and get info on the less pragma but "man less"
will still get you the less pager manpage.

If you have modules or other non-stock perl files the simplest thing
to do is to move /usr/lib/perl5 to /usr/libdata/perl5 and add a link
from /usr/lib/perl5 to /usr/libdata/perl5.  Alternately, you could
just edit the installed Config.pm file and fix up the paths there.

      Compiler Change: egcs replaces gcc

   This change is likely the most significant change you will encounter.
   For detailed instructions, see section [34]4.2.

      Kernel Structure - statfs - changed

   The statfs structure has changed as of May 31. You must rebuild your
   kernel before attempting a make build. See [35]4.3 for details.

    4.2: How do I upgrade gcc to egcs

   The safest way will be to upgrade to a recent snapshot, once one is
   available. Look for a snapshot first!. Bootstrapping the new compiler
   from the old should be a last resort.

   First, note that some platforms have not been bootstrapped
   successfully yet. To date, the following should work, if you are
   careful:
     * i386
     * sparc
     * m68k
     * alpha

   mips and rs6000 have problems.

   To test whether your platform can be bootstrapped, grab and install
   the egcs-snapshot, available from the [36]ports collection. If this
   works, the in-tree version likely will, too. This is the safest method
   of proceeding.

   Now, before going any further, ensure that your copies of binutils,
   gas, and ld are up to date. Note that there are two copies of gas and
   ld in the tree. On i386 and sparc, the binutils versions are not used.
   Check /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/gas and /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/ld instead.

   The following instructions referred to the original egcs snapshot
   (egcs-990517). Since that time, a second snapshot (egcs-990608) has
   gone into the tree. If you are coming from vanilla 2.5, it is unlikely
   that you will be able to build the latest version directly. In this
   event, you will have to bootstrap an intermediate version using these
   instructions.

   From espie@openbsd.org:

Today, the compiler changes.

Exit gcc 2.8.1, enter egcs... or more precisely, gcc 2.95 prerelease.

This is probably going to be a rough ride, but I can't work out all
the kinks on every architecture by myself.

I'm going to start importing stuff *now*. There will be a second message
to tech@ once things are settled...

Thanks to everyone who helped me sorting stuff out, most especially
niklas, turan, and millert.

Why the switch
--------------
as most of you already know, egcs is now the *official* compiler supported
by the FSF.  The upcoming july release as been re-christened gcc 2.95.

Just looking at the log messages will show you many improvements:
support for newer processors is better, C++ is more accurately matching
the ANSI/ISO standards, Fortran 77 is more closely integrated.
There are also countless bug-fixes and code generation improvements.

Also the development is more open. There is a cvs tree, there are several
mailing-lists available, and we are cooperating closely with the egcs
team. More precisely, I've been feeding patches back to the egcs team
so that OpenBSD configurations are officially supported.
Also, the development team is highly responsive to bug-reports, and problems
get fixed.

There also is a band-wagon phenomenon: everyone is switching to egcs,
which means lots of code to test the compiler on, and that we can benefit
from related projects.

Why now
-------
egcs-1.1 was unfit for some purposes. Specifically, code size on i386
was larger than gcc 2.8.1, which yielded floppy-disks problems.
At 2.5 freeze, the only code fit to include was a somewhat unstable
snapshot.  In the interest of stability, after much pondering, egcs was
not put into 2.5.

Right now, the egcs project is going through a release cycle which will
yield egcs 1.2.  Judging from their time schedule, there is ample margin
between egcs 1.2 and the next release of OpenBSD.  Also, we want to get
in now, so that we get a chance to report problems on less frequently
used architectures, and get everything fixed for 1.2.

egcs `feature freeze' is supposed to occur on may 7th, and the current
snapshot 19990502 looks solid.

What works and what doesn't
---------------------------
egcs runs an i386 OpenBSD system without problems.  m68k works as well,
with a few work-arounds linked to obscure bugs that will get fixed.
sparc seems to be running as well.  There is some linker trouble on some
other arches that needs to be fixed before our next release.

Right now, constructors across dynamic libraries are not quite ready.

egcs now features a stand-alone cpp which is going to be better than
the current hackish solution we use. This means a few interface changes
and possibly weird warnings.

Keeping gcc 2.8.1 ?
-------------------
due to size constraints, as soon as egcs is imported, gcc is going
to move to cvs Attic.  If you don't want to deal with egcs now, you'll
have to be careful through your cvs updates.
Some Makefiles are bound to change: includes, gnu/usr.bin, and gnu/lib.
xlint and cpp.sh are going to change as well.

How to bootstrap the compiler
-----------------------------
the simplest way is probably to trust the various arch maintainers
and download a snapshot.

If you want to do stuff the hard way, you must first remake proper
obj dirs:
cd /usr/src
make obj

If you run i386, gas must be up-to-date.
If you run sparc, ld must be up-to-date.

then build libiberty:
cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs/libiberty
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper depend
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

then the C compiler:
cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs/gcc
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper depend
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

rebuild the C compiler with the new version:
cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs/gcc
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper depend
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

rebuild the includes
cd /usr/src/include
make includes

build all egcs libraries and install them
cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper depend
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

install the new cpp driver
cd /usr/src/usr.bin/cpp
make install

then you're all set, and a standard make build should work...

     [author note: Actually, it doesn't quite work. xlint will fail to
     build. The fix is simple though. Simply do a make && make install
     in the /usr/src/usr.bin/xlint/xlint directory before you attempt a
     make build and proceed. See [37]4.2.2.]
If it doesn't, you're using an arch that didn't go through make build yet.
The most probably occurrence is an Internal Compiler Error, as known as an
ICE.

First try to see if the ICE will go away with -O1 or -O0. In that case, you
can put a work-around in the Makefile until it's fixed
(see /usr/src/lib/libm/Makefile for an example of how to put in such
work-arounds for m68k).

Then the error needs to be reported to the egcs-bugs mailing list.

At a minimum, you must run the source through the same compiler invocation,
with an addition of -v -save-temps to the options.

-v yields the precise sequence of commands invoked by gcc. -save-temps
will give you a pre-processed C file (.i) or C++ (.ii) that the egcs people
can make sense of... you can't ask them to run OpenBSD on their boxes.

If you have more time, you can try to trim down the pre-processed C file to
the bare minimum that triggers the bug. Dichotomy works nicely.

   If you made it through this procedure, and everything is still
   working, congratulations. If not, check the following sections for
   advice. Problems not listed here should be posted to tech@openbsd.org.

      4.2.1 - i386 and sparc are no longer #define'ed

   This is true. egcs uses the cleaner __i386__ and __sparc__. If you
   need to compile code that relies on the old defines, add a -Dsparc or
   -Di386 to the appropriate location of your Makefile.

      4.2.2 - Build fails in xlint

   This is due to semantic differences in cpp. The workaround is simple,
   and similar to the cap_mkdb issue described in [38]3.1.

   Do a:
# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/xlint/xlint
# make && make install

   now re-run make, and the build should continue.

      4.2.3 - Core Dump on uthread_autoinit.c

   You have fallen victim to a linker bug. Here's a relevant message:
From: Marc Espie
Subject: egcs core-dumping on uthread_autoinit.c

If this happens to you, this is a known linker problem... the cc1 you have
was linked in a weird way.

Initially, I made cc1 link against static /usr/lib/libiberty.a to avoid this
problem, but this was cutting things too close, and the bug reappeared,
probably thanks to unrelated changes in libc or elsewhere...

The tree has been patched with a work-around in

src/gnu/egcs/f/lang-options.h

make sure you have the kludged version of that file (at least rev 1.2),
recompile and reinstall cc1, the problem should go away.

What's going on is that the 386 linker gets something wrong because of
the huge strings array in toplev.c, and something gets mislinked, so
that
void f(void) __attribute((constructor)) {}
kills cc1.

As a work-around, I've killed Fortran options help texts, until someone finds
where the linker errs.

      4.2.4 - egcs seems much slower than gcc

   It is, but there is a reason. egcs performs more optimizing passes.
   Data alignment and other such functionality will be better with
   egcs-generated code.

      4.2.5 - egcs generates larger code than gcc

   Yes it does. This is especially noticable with the old -O2 gcc switch.
   egcs introduces a new option, -Os which optimizes for space. This is
   roughly comparable to the old -O2 behavior.

      4.2.6 - After installing egcs I have very little disk space left

   egcs installs into a different subdirectory than gcc 2.8.1. You may
   remove gcc once egcs is bootstrapped and working. (on a related note,
   the perl changes mentioned in [39]4.1 mean that you can remove the
   /usr/lib/perl5 directory. The new location for this data is
   /usr/libdata/perl5.)

      4.2.7 - My build dies while making libcurses

   libcurses now relies on the latest version of cpp. Fetch the latest
   version, rebuild cpp, and continue. Eg:
# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/cpp && make install

   And try the make build again.

      4.2.8 - make obj fails

   If your make obj fails, citing errors in a Makefile, your makefile
   includes are likely out of date. For example:
===> lib/libkvm
"Makefile", line 30: Malformed conditional ((${UVM} == "yes"))
"Makefile", line 30: Missing dependency operator
"Makefile", line 32: if-less endif
"Makefile", line 32: Need an operator
Fatal errors encountered -- cannot continue

   This can be solved by rebuilding the makefile includes. Do a:
cd /usr/src/share/mk && make install

   and try the build again.

    4.3: My make build dies with unimplemented syscall errors.

   Short Answer:

   The kernel structure statfs has changed. You will need to recompile
   the kernel before attempting a make build.

   Long Answer:

   The kernel structure statfs has changed. The new struct statfs has the
   following features:
     * Has a u_int32_t flags field--now softdep can have a real flag.
     * Uses u_int32_t instead of longs (nicer on the alpha). Note: the
       man page used to lie about setting invalid/unused fields to -1.
       SunOS does that but our code never has.
     * Gets rid of f_type completely. It hasn't been used since NetBSD
       0.9 and having it there but always 0 is confusing. It is
       conceivable that this may cause some old code to not compile but
       that is better than silently breaking.
     * Adds a mount_info union that contains the FSTYPE_args struct. This
       means that mount can now tell you all the options a filesystem was
       mounted with. This is especially nice for NFS.

   Other changes:
     * The linux statfs emulation didn't convert between BSD fs names and
       linux f_type numbers. Now it does, since the BSD f_type number is
       useless to linux apps (and has been removed anyway)
     * FreeBSD's struct statfs is different from our (both old and new)
       and thus needs conversion. Previously, the OpenBSD syscalls were
       used without any real translation.
     * mount(8) will now show extra info when invoked with no arguments.
       However, to see everything you need to use the -v (verbose) flag.

    4.4: Link to the new 2.6 directory.

   When upgrading to 2.6 you'll need to create one simple link for gcc.
cd /usr/lib/gcc-lib
ln -s ${ARCH}-unknown-openbsd2.5 ${ARCH}-unknown-openbsd2.6

    4.5: After an (U)pgrade, extraction of base26.tar.gz fails with a message:

   tar: Unable to remove directory ./usr/include/machine

   In 2.5, /usr/include/machine was a directory, and /usr/include/i386
   was a link to it. In 2.6, this situation is reversed.

   To correct the problem, escape to the shell, remove the
   /usr/include/machine directory, and retry the upgrade.

  5.0 - Upgrading from 2.6 to -current

    5.1: Termcap entries are too long.

   There is a new termcaps.master file. You will need to regenerate the
   terminfo and termcaps files with the current version of tic(1). If you
   are upgrading via make build, the correct version of tic(1) will be
   used and this will be done for you. If not, you will get the following
   error:
    terminfo.src is corrupt! You need to update /usr/bin/tic

   In this case, you must either rebuild and install tic(1) (being sure
   to use the current version of libcurses) or simply build the version
   of tic(1) in your source tree.

    5.2: My pn (or mx, al, ax) device is no longer recognized by the kernel.

   (Note: pn is used below for simplicity. This should be taken to read
   pn, mx, al, or ax as appropriate)

   These four drivers were replaced with the a unified dc driver. You
   must change all occurences of pn*, mx, al, or ax in your configuration
   files. This includes:
     * Updating your kernel configuration file(s). (Hint: start with a
       fresh GENERIC kernel, and modify from there)
     * mv'ing /etc/hostname.pn* to /etc/hostname.dc*
     * Updating your /etc/ifaliases file.
     * Changing your /etc/ipnat.rules and /etc/ipf.rules to reflect the
       new interface name.

   If you are modifying a custom kernel, make sure you have included the
   dcphy device, in your kernel config, as follows:
dcphy*  at mii? phy ?                           # Digital Clone PHYs

   While you are at it, you may also want to add:
ukphy*  at mii? phy ?                           # "unknown" PHYs

    5.3: Upgrading gcc 2.95.1 to 2.95.2

   gcc 2.95.2 was merged into the OpenBSD source tree around January 19,
   2000. In order for gcc to build properly, the most recent (post 2.6)
   libiberty is required. To build this library, do the following:
        cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs/libiberty
        make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
        make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper obj
        make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper
        make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

   Once libiberty is build, you may proceed with a standard gcc
   bootstrap:
   cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs/gcc
   make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
   make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper obj
   make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper -DBOOTSTRAP
   make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper -DBOOTSTRAP install
   make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
   make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper
   make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

Welcome to the OpenBSD/i386 2.6 installation program.

This program is designed to help you put OpenBSD on your disk in a simple and
rational way.

As with anything which modifies your disk's contents, this program can cause
SIGNIFICANT data loss, and you are advised to make sure your data is backed
up before beginning the installation process.

Default answers are displayed in brackets after the questions.  You can hit
Control-C at any time to quit, but if you do so at a prompt, you may have
to hit return.  Also, quitting in the middle of installation may leave your
system in an inconsistent state.  If you hit Control-C and restart the
install, the install program will remember many of your old answers.

You can run a shell command at any prompt via '!foo'
or escape to a shell by simply typing '!'.

Specify terminal type [pcvt25]: _

The installation program needs to know which disk to consider the root disk.
Note the unit number may be different than the unit number you used in the
boot program (especially on a PC with multiple disk controllers).
Available disks are:

sd0
wd0
wd1

Which disk is the root disk? [] _wd0
Do you want to use the *entire* disk for OpenBSD? [no] _yes

Inside the BIOS 'A6' ('OpenBSD') partition you just created, there resides an
OpenBSD partition table which defines how this BIOS partition is to be split
up. This table declares the offsets and sizes of your / partition, your swap
space, and any other partitions you might create.  (NOTE: The OpenBSD disk
label offsets are absolute, ie. relative to the start of the disk... NOT
relative to the start of the BIOS 'A6' partition).

disklabel: no disk label
WARNING: Disk wd0 has no label. You will be creating a new one.

If this disk is shared with other operating systems, those operating systems
should have a BIOS partition entry that spans the space they occupy completely.
For safety, also make sure all OpenBSD file systems are within the offset and
size specified in the 'A6' BIOS partition table.  (By default, the disklabel
editor will try to enforce this).  If you are unsure of how to use multiple
partitions properly (ie. separating /,  /usr, /tmp, /var, /usr/local, and other
things) just split the space into a root and swap partition for now.

You can use the 'b command to change this.

You will now have the opportunity to enter filesystem information for wd0.
You will be prompted for the mount point (full path, including the prepending
'/' character) for each BSD partition on wd0.  Enter "none" to skip a
partition or "done" when you are finished.

The following partitions will be used for the root filesystem and swap:
        wd0a    /
        wd0b    swap

Mount point for wd0d (size=65520k) [/tmp, RET, none, or done]? _
Mount point for wd0e (size=65520k) [/var, RET, none, or done]? _
Mount point for wd0g (size=307440k) [/usr, RET, none, or done]? _
Mount point for wd0h (size=1926256k) [/home, RET, none, or done]? _done

Nowq you can select another disk to initialize.  (Do not re-select a
disk you have already entered information for).  Available disks are:

sd0
wd0
wd1

Which one? [done] _

You have configured the following devices and mount points:

wd0a /
wd0d /tmp
wd0e /var
wd0g /usr
wd0h /home

Filesystems will now be created on these devices.
If you made any mistakes, you may edit this now.
Edit using ed? [n] _

============================================================
The next step will overwrite any existing data on:

You will now be given the opportunity to configure the network.  This will be
useful if you need to transfer the installation sets via FTP, HTTP, or NFS.
Even if you choose not to transfer installation sets that way, this information
will be preserved and copied into the new root filesystem.

It is now time to extract the installation sets onto the hard disk.  Make sure
the sets are either on a local device (i.e. tape, CD-ROM) or on a network
server.  You will have the chance to repeat this step or to extract sets from
several places, so you don't have to try to load all the sets in one try and
can recover from some errors.

Install from (f)tp, (h)ttp, (t)ape, (C)D-ROM, (N)FS or local (d)isk? _c

The following CD-ROM devices are installed on your system; please select
the CD-ROM device containing the partition with the installation sets:

cd0

Which is the CD-ROM with the nistallation media? [abort] _cd0
CD-ROM partition to mount (normally "c")? [c] _

There are two CD-ROM filesystem types currently supported by this program:
cd9660          ISO-9660
ffs             Berkeley Fast Filesystem

Which filesystem type? [cd9660] _
Enter the directory relative to the mount point that
contains the file. [/2.6/i386] _

You will now be asked for files to extract.  In addition to the
files listed in the selector you may enter any file located in
/mnt2//2.6/i386.  You can also enter 'all' to install all the standard
sets, or 'list' to list the files avilable in /mnt2//2.6/i386.
When you are done selecting files, enter 'done'.
Some of these sets are required for your install and some are optional --
You will want at least the base and bsd sets.
Consult the intallation notes if you are not sure which sets are required!

The following sets are available for extraction.
Enter filename, `list', `all', or `done'.
You may de-select a set by prepending a '-' to it's name.

        [X] base26.tar.gz

Two OpenBSD libraries (libssl and libcrypto, based on OpenSSL) implement many
cryptographic functions which are used by OpenBSD programs like ssh, httpd, and
isakmpd.  Due to patent licensing reasons, those libraries may not be included
on the CD -- instead the base distribution contains libraries which have had
the troublesome code removed -- the programs listed above will not be fully
functional as a result.  Libraries which _include_ the troublesome routines
are available and can be FTP installed, as long as you meet the follow (legal)
criteria:
  (1) Outside the USA, no restrictions apply. Use ssl26.tar.gz.
  (2) Inside the USA, non-commercial entities may install sslUSA26.tar.gz.
  (3) Commercial entities in the USA are left in the cold, due to how the
      licences work.  (This is how the USA crypto export policy feels to the
      rest of the world.)

If you do not install the ssl package now, it is easily installed at
a later time (see the afterboot(8) and ssl(8) manual pages)."
Install (U)SA, (I)nternational, or (N)one? [none] _i
Install SSL+RSA libraries via (f)tp, (h)ttp, or (c)ancel? [ftp] _f
Enter system hostname (short form): [] _mybox
Enter DNS domain name: [] _someisp.com

If you have any devices being configured by a DHCP server
it is recommended that you do not enter a default route or
any name servers.

You may configure the following network interfaces (the interfaces marked
with [X] have been successfully configured):

        [ ] xl0
        [ ] fxp0

Configure which interface? (or, enter 'done') [xl0] _
IP address (or 'dhcp')? [] _199.185.137.55
Symbolic (host) name? [mybox] _
Netmask ? [255.255.255.0] _
Your network interface might require non-default
media directives.  The default media is:
        media: Ethernet 100baseTX half-duplex
This is a list of supported media:
        media autoselect
        media 100baseTX mediaopt full-duplex
        media 100baseTX mediaopt half-duplex
        media 100baseTX
        media 10baseT mediaopt full-duplex
        media 10baseT
        media 10baseT mediaopt half-duplex
If the default is not satisfactory, and you wish to use another
media, copy that line from above (ie. "media 100baseTX")
Media directives? [] _

You may configure the following network interfaces (the interfaces marked
with [X] have been successfully configured):

        [X] xl0
        [ ] fxp0

Enter IP address of default route: [none] _199.185.137.128
Enter IP address of primary nameserver: [none] _199.185.137.1
Would you like to use the nameserver now? [y] _

You will now be given the opportunity to escape to the command shell to do
any additional network configuration you may need.  This may include adding
additional routes, if needed.  In addition, you might take this opportunity
to redo the default route in the event that it failed above.
Escape to shell? [n] _

HTTP/FTP proxy URL? (ie. "http://proxy:8080", or "none") [none] _

By default, ftp will attempt a passive connection and fall back to a normal
(active) connection if that doesn't work.  However, there are some very
old ftp servers that claim to support passive mode, but really do not.
In this case, you should explicitly request an active session.
Do you want to use active ftp? [n] _n
Do you want a list of potential ftp servers? [y] _y
