<h2>11.1 - Introduction to X</h2>

The X Window System (sometimes just called "X", other times, incorrectly
called "X Windows") is the environment which provides graphics services
to OpenBSD and other Unix-based systems.
However, by itself, X provides very little: one also must have a "Window
Manager", to present a user interface.
Most of the "personality" one will feel from X will be due to the 
window manager, rather than X itself.
OpenBSD ships with a free version of the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fvwm&amp;sektion=1">fvwm(1)</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cwm&amp;sektion=1">cwm(1)</a>
window managers, although you may wish to use any of the other window managers
that are in <a href="faq15.html">packages</a>.
Search using a key of "<tt>window manager</tt>" for a list of the many window
managers available.

<p>
X is considered a "client-server" structured protocol, however the 
terminology is sometimes confusing.
The computer with the graphics on the screen is the "X Server".
The application which directs the X server what to put on its screen
is the "X Client", even though it may be a much more powerful computer
in a data center.
This model can be used to have large, processor intensive applications
(X clients) running on a very powerful machine, using the X Server
running on a small, low power machine on your desk for their user 
interface.

<p>
It is possible to run X clients on a system without any graphical
support.
For example, one could have an application (the X client) running on an
mvme88k, displaying its output on an alpha's graphical display (the X
server).
Since X is a well-defined, cross-platform protocol, it is even possible
to have an X application running on (for example) a Solaris machine 
use an OpenBSD machine for its display.

<p>
The client and server can also be running on the same machine, and for 
most of this section, that will be the assumption.

<h3>11.1.1 - How much computer do I need to run X?</h3>
X itself is a pretty large program, a fast computer will be appreciated
if you are starting it and stopping it regularly.
However, once running, it performs pretty responsively on a very modest
computer.
To get responsive display performance on some platforms, even for just
text, you will want to run X.
These platforms, such as <a href="../sparc.html">sparc</a> and
<a href="../sparc64.html">sparc64</a>, were intended to be used with a
graphical interface, and the text console performance is very poor.

<p>
That being said, the point of running X is usually to run X
applications.
Some X applications are very lean, others will seemingly take and use
all the processor and RAM you can give them.
Of course, some users just like to use X to provide a large number of 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=xterm&amp;sektion=1">xterm(1)</a>s,
which can be done on very modest hardware.

<h3>11.1.2 - Can I have any kind of graphics without X?</h3>
Assuming you won't accept
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_Art">ASCII graphics</a>,
that requires some kind of framebuffer console driver.
Some operating systems provide this, but there is not currently one for
OpenBSD, nor is there much interest among developers for one.

<p>
<a name="ConfigX"></a>
<h2>11.2 - Configuring X</h2>
<b>Good news:  In the vast majority of hardware in most platforms, X
requires no configuration at all, it Just Works.</b>

<p>
The details of manual configuration of X varies considerably from
platform to platform.
In all cases, there will be instructions and other platform-specific
information in <tt>/usr/X11R6/README</tt> in the installed system.

<p>
Several platforms require the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=xf86&amp;sektion=4">xf86(4)</a>
X aperture driver, which provides access to the memory and I/O 
ports of a VGA board and the PCI configuration registers required 
by the X servers.
This driver must be enabled before it is used, either by answering 
"yes" to this question during install:

<blockquote><pre>
Do you expect to run the X window System [no]
</pre></blockquote>

or by changing the value of <tt>machdep.allowaperture</tt> to the
appropriate non-zero value in <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt> for your
platform, and rebooting the machine (this sysctl cannot be changed
after boot has been completed for security reasons).
There are security implications to this, so do not do this if you 
do not need it.


<h3>11.2.1 - alpha</h3>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/xenocara/distrib/notes/README.alpha"
>/usr/X11R6/README</a> for alpha.

<p>
Set <tt>machdep.allowaperture=1</tt> in <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt>.

<p>
The TGA and some VGA cards are supported.
No further configuration should be needed.

<h3>11.2.2 - amd64</h3>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/xenocara/distrib/notes/README.amd64"
>/usr/X11R6/README</a> for amd64.

<p>
Set <tt>machdep.allowaperture=2</tt> in <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt>.

<p>
For the vast majority of users, X on amd64 auto-configures successfully,
so no further configuration is needed.
IF further configuration is needed, use the 
<a href="#amd64i386">X&nbsp;-configure</a>
process <a href="#amd64i386example">below</a>.

<h3>11.2.3 - armish</h3>
No X servers, only X clients.

<h3>11.2.4 - hp300</h3>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/xenocara/distrib/notes/README.hp300"
>/usr/X11R6/README</a> for hp300.

<h3>11.2.5 - hppa</h3>
No X server, only X clients.

<h3>11.2.6 - i386</h3>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/xenocara/distrib/notes/README.i386"
>/usr/X11R6/README</a> for i386.

<p>
Set <tt>machdep.allowaperture=2</tt> in <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt>.

<p>
For the vast majority of users, X on i386 auto-configures successfully,
so no further configuration is needed.
IF further configuration is needed, use the
<a href="#amd64i386">X&nbsp;-configure</a>
process <a href="#amd64i386example">below</a>.

<h3>11.2.7 - landisk</h3>
No X servers, only X clients.

<h3>11.2.8 - loongson</h3>
No configuration needed.

<h3>11.2.9 - luna88k</h3>
No X servers, only X clients.

<h3>11.2.10 - macppc</h3>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/xenocara/distrib/notes/README.macppc"
>/usr/X11R6/README</a> for macppc.
   
<p>
Set <tt>machdep.allowaperture=2</tt> in <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt>.

<p> 
Supported Macintosh PPC systems can be run in one of two different ways:
"accelerated" and "framebuffer" (unaccelerated).

<p>
In the "framebuffer" mode, the system will be running with 8 bits per
pixel, and the video resolution is controlled by the Macintosh
environment, so you will probably want to keep a small MacOS section on
your disk to adjust these settings.
This mode has the advantage of "Just Working", however it can be 
frustratingly inflexible (for example, altering resolution may require
booting MacOS).

<p>
If your Macintosh has an ATI-based video system, it can run using an 
accelerated X server, which gives better performance and more control
in the OpenBSD environment.
The NVIDIA video cards in some macppc systems will also work in many
cases.
The README file has details on configuring the accelerated driver, start
by using the sample file there.

<p>
While the README file details using the standard Apple one-button mouse
with X, unless you are using a laptop, it is highly recommended that you
just buy a modern third-party USB mouse with three or more buttons.

<h4>CRT iMacs and X</h4>
iMacs have a very unusual (in this day) CRT, in that it has a fixed
horizontal scan frequency.
Attempting to use a horizontal sweep speed outside a very narrow range
will cause the monitor to not light up.
The following lines, added to xorg.conf in the <tt>Section
"Monitor"</tt> area seem to make a lot of CRT-based iMacs in the 333MHz
to 500MHz range (and possibly more!) work well:

<blockquote><pre>
        HorizSync       60.0 - 60.0
        VertRefresh     43.0 - 117.0 
</pre></blockquote>

You may wish to restrict the lower limit of <tt>VertRefresh</tt> to
values that you are more likely to find acceptable, for example 70.

<h3>11.2.11 - mvme68k</h3>
No X servers, only X clients.

<h3>11.2.12 - mvme88k</h3>
No X servers, only X clients.

<h3>11.2.13 - sgi</h3>
X runs on the O2 system's frame buffer in unaccelerated mode.

<h3>11.2.14 - sparc</h3>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/xenocara/distrib/notes/README.sparc"
>/usr/X11R6/README</a> for sparc.

<p>
With a single supported framebuffer, there is no configuration needed.
If you wish to use a multi-headed configuration, see the above README file
for details.

<p>
Resolution is controlled by the firmware before booting OpenBSD.

<h3>11.2.15 - sparc64</h3>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/xenocara/distrib/notes/README.sparc64"
>/usr/X11R6/README</a> for sparc64.

<p>
Most simple configurations now "Just Work".
If yours does not or you wish to get fancy, see the above README file.

<h3>11.2.16 - vax</h3>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/xenocara/distrib/notes/README.vax"
>/usr/X11R6/README</a> for vax.

<p>
The X server currently only works on VAXstation 4000 models with either a 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=lcg&amp;sektion=4&amp;arch=vax">lcg(4)</a>
or
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=lcspx&amp;sektion=4&amp;arch=vax">lcspx(4)</a>
framebuffer.

<h3>11.2.17 - zaurus</h3>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/xenocara/distrib/notes/README.zaurus"
>/usr/X11R6/README</a> for zaurus.

<p>
No configuration needed, X "Just Works".


<p>
<a name="amd64i386"></a>
<h2>11.3 - Configuring X on amd64 and i386</h2>
If you haven't tried <a href="#StartingX">just starting X</a>, stop!
Don't make work for yourself if you you don't need to!
Most i386 and amd64 users will find X Just Works without any manual
configuration.

<h3>11.3.1 - X.Org configuration</h3>
Sometimes, X does not "just work" as desired, and sometimes, you need to
customize something that does work.

<p>
If X does not work as desired with your system, you will need to create a
configuration file.
A good starting place (and sometimes, a good ending place!) is to run
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=Xorg&amp;sektion=1">Xorg(1)</a>
in the "X -configure" mode.
This will load all available video driver modules,
probes for other hardware, and based on what it finds, writes out a xorg.conf
file that may or may not work.
Even if it does not work, it will be a useful starting point for
creating one that works as desired.

<p>
Another time-honored way to
configure X is to use your favorite search engine to hunt for someone
else who already solved your problem.
Note that <tt>xorg.conf</tt> files for other Unix-like OSs will often
provide very useful tips on what you need to get X running on your
similar hardware.
While that's not a bad way, that method won't be emphasized here.

<p>
<a name="amd64i386example"></a>
<h3>11.3.2 - Our example machine</h3>
As a demonstration of setting up X, we will use an old Celeron 400MHz
system, with an AGP video slot.
The video card is an old AGP card, shown in the dmesg as:

<blockquote><pre>
vga1 at pci1 dev 0 function 0 "3DFX Interactive Banshee" rev 0x03
</pre></blockquote>

This is a once high-end video card, with 16M RAM, but is now mostly
unsupported on modern versions of "mainstream" operating systems.
The monitor attached to the system is a Sony Multiscan G400 19" CRT
monitor, and it would be nice to run this monitor at 1280x1024, with 
a decent refresh rate, and 24 bit color.

<p>
First, after installing OpenBSD with X (and making sure the aperture
driver is enabled in the kernel), let's see what X.Org's auto detection
and configuration does, after all, we might get lucky.
So, we simply log in and use the command
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=startx&amp;sektion=1">startx(1)</a>.
The screen goes blank for a few moments, then we get the X
"checkerboard" background, the "X" cursor, and then an xterm window.

<p>
It works!

<p>
More or less.
While the system is fully functional, it doesn't appear to have picked
up any of the capabilities of the monitor, and is running at what is
clearly a low resolution (640x480).
We hope to do better than this.
Much better, in fact.
This does mean we need to make our own xorg.conf file, however.

<p>
Let's use the "X -configure" process to generate a starting <tt>xorg.conf</tt>
file.
You will need to do this as root:
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>X -configure</b>
 [...]
Your xorg.conf file is /root/xorg.conf.new

To test the server, run 'X -config /root/xorg.conf.new'
</pre></blockquote>

By the way, the message is serious -- use the entire path to your 
<tt>xorg.conf.new</tt> file, even if it is sitting in your current
default directory.
Failing to do so will result in
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=X&amp;sektion=7">X(7)</a>
not finding the file, and it will silently use the default
configuration, and if that had worked, you wouldn't be using this
process!
This can set back your troubleshooting quite a bit.
Trust us on this.

<p>
Let's do as it says, and see what we get:
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>X -config /root/xorg.conf.new</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Now, all we get is a black screen.
Things had started out so well...

<p>
This might be a really good time to talk about ways of 
exiting X when started in this way.
In order of preference:
<ul>
<li><b>CTRL-ALT-Backspace</b>:  This hopefully causes X to immediately
terminate, along with all X applications that are running.
Of course, during the configuration process, you don't have any 
applications running, so this is not a problem (and in fact, at
this point, this is your <i>best</i> way to exit X).
<li><b>SSH into the box</b>, and 
"<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pkill&amp;sektion=1">pkill</a>
Xorg", which may kill the X process, and may return you to a usable console.
<li><b>SSH into the box</b> and reboot it.
<li><b>Reset or power button.</b>  Sometimes things go really bad.
Yes, it is usually good to get X running before you load critical
applications on the system.
Sometimes, a bad X configuration will hang the entire machine to the 
point that only a hard reset will resolve the problem.
</ul>

Fortunately for us, CTRL-ALT-Backspace does the job here, and we
are returned to a command prompt.
So now we need to see if we can figure out what is wrong.
First, we should look at what Xorg thinks is going on, and that is 
recorded in the file <tt>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</tt>.
In this case, it appears that X thinks all is running fine, there are no
obviously significant errors shown in the log (lines that start with an
"<tt>(EE)</tt>" are errors).

<p>
Here is where knowing your hardware comes in handy.
Attaching this system to a different monitor while it is showing the
blank screen produces a "Sync. Out of Range" message on the display.
So, apparently the configuration X gave us will not run on this monitor,
and may not run on ANY monitor, if a video mode was selected that isn't
possible for this particular card (keep in mind, X is looking at the
chips on the card, and what they are potentially capable of, not how the
manufacturer put it all together).
Different monitors will do different things when the timing is way off,
some will attempt to display what they can, others will drop to power 
saving mode, some will make horrible noises, some will display useful
messages on the screen.
This monitor seems to do none of the above.
A note is made to NOT use this monitor for initial X configuration in
the future.

<p>
Looking through the generated xorg.conf.new file, we see this:
<blockquote><pre>
Section "Monitor"
        #DisplaySize      370   270     # mm
        Identifier   "Monitor0"
        VendorName   "SNY"
        ModelName    "SONY CPD-G400"
 ### Comment all HorizSync and VertSync values to use DDC:
        HorizSync    30.0 - 107.0
        VertRefresh  48.0 - 120.0
        Option      "DPMS"
EndSection
</pre></blockquote>

As a test, let's try using DDC ("Data Display Channel", a way the
monitor can tell the computer and video card what it is capable of), and
see what happens.
This time, we get the X mesh pattern and the moving cursor, which is all
we expect when invoking X in this way (we terminate X using the
CTRL-ALT-Backspace trick above).
It is (again) a very low resolution, but it is working, so we can be
pretty sure we have a timing and resolution problem.
We'll restore the "HorizSync" and "VertRefresh" lines as they were,
as we have verified this monitor's specs through a bit of Internet
searching.

<p>
Let's try to force Xorg to a particular resolution, and see if we have any
luck.
In the <tt>Section "Screen"</tt> part of the xorg.conf file, we want to add 
a couple lines.
The added lines are shown in bold:

<blockquote><pre>
Section "Screen"
        Identifier "Screen0"
        Device     "Card0"
        Monitor    "Monitor0"
<b>        DefaultDepth   24</b>
        SubSection "Display"
                Viewport   0 0
                Depth     1
        EndSubSection
        SubSection "Display"
                Viewport   0 0
                Depth     4
        EndSubSection
        SubSection "Display"
                Viewport   0 0
                Depth     8
        EndSubSection
        SubSection "Display"
                Viewport   0 0
                Depth     15
        EndSubSection
        SubSection "Display"
                Viewport   0 0 
                Depth     16
        EndSubSection
        SubSection "Display"
                Viewport   0 0
                Depth     24
<b>                Modes	"1280x1024"</b>
        EndSubSection
EndSection
</pre></blockquote>

These two changes tell X we want to use a 24 bit display depth, and 
for 24 bit depths, we want the resolution 1280x1024.
As no other resolution is listed for "Depth 24", the system will 
be forced to that resolution.

<p>
We test as above, and...  SUCCESS!
We have what appears to be a very nice, high resolution display.
Note that ALL that is expected is a mesh pattern (very good for seeing
how good your monitor REALLY is and also great for calibrating LCD
displays, called the
"<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/xenocara/data/bitmaps/root_weave">root
weave</a>") and a movable cursor.
It is not intended to be functional at this point.

<p>
Now, we want to install this xorg.conf file so we can see how well we
are really doing with usable running of X.

<blockquote><pre>
# cp xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf
</pre></blockquote>

We can now try X using the normal startx(1) command.
It works!

<p>
It would probably be good to verify that we are at the resolution and
color depth we desire, and also that we are running at a respectable
refresh rate.
We can do that with the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=xrandr&amp;sektion=1">xrandr(1)</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=xdpyinfo&amp;sektion=1">xdpyinfo(1)</a>
commands.
Among other things, xdpyinfo(1) tells us:
<blockquote><pre>
    [...]
screen #0:
  print screen:    no
  dimensions:    1280x1024 pixels (433x347 millimeters)
  resolution:    75x75 dots per inch
  depths (7):    24, 1, 4, 8, 15, 16, 32
  root window id:    0x44
  depth of root window:    24 planes
    [...]
</pre></blockquote>

So, yes, we are running at 1280x1024 with a depth of 24 planes (bits).

<p>
xrandr(4) tells us:
<blockquote><pre>
 SZ:    Pixels          Physical       Refresh
*0   1280 x 1024   ( 433mm x 347mm )  *85   75   60  
 1   1280 x 960    ( 433mm x 347mm )   85   60  
    [...]
</pre></blockquote>

which tells us we are running with an 85Hz refresh rate, so this should
be a very comfortable setting for most users.

<p>
<h3>11.3.3 - What if it isn't that "easy"?</h3>
Sometimes, things just don't go together.
Here are some tips.

<ul>
<li>Read the man page for the X server you are using.
In our example, <tt>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</tt> shows X is using TDFX as
the driver, so that would be the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tdfx&amp;sektion=4">tdfx(4)</a>
man page.
You will often find tips, limitations, and options for configuring your
video card.
These vary from driver to driver, so don't assume you don't need to read the 
man page for the driver you are using now because you read a different one
before.

<li>Try different monitors.
As we discovered in our above example, different monitors will often give 
different clues as to what might be wrong.

<li>Try the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vesa&amp;sektion=4">vesa(4)</a>
X driver.
This is definitely a "last choice" for performance reasons, but it works
on almost all video cards, including those for which none of the "better"
X server drivers will work with.

<li>Use different hardware.
If you have a choice of video cards to use, try some others.


</ul>

<a name="StartingX"></a>
<h2>11.4 - Starting X</h2>
There are two common ways to run X:

<h3>11.4.1 - On Demand:</h3>
Log in to a console as normal, then run
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=startx&amp;sektion=1">startx(1)</a>.

<h3>11.4.2 - Boot directly into X:</h3>
This is done using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=xdm&amp;sektion=1">xdm(1)</a>,
the X Display Manager.
xdm(1) is started as root, normally by <a href="faq10.html#rc">rc</a>,
and presents a login prompt.
Upon successful login, it starts an X session for that user.
If or when that X session should be terminated (including by hitting 
CTRL-ALT-Backspace), xdm(1) will return, prompting the user to login again.
For this reason, do NOT attempt to start xdm(1) from
<tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt> until you have verified X works as you wish,
or your machine may become very difficult to manage!
(worst case: boot single user, as if you <a href="faq8.html#LostPW">lost
your password</a>, and edit out the xdm_flags line in your
<tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt> file.)

<p>
On some platforms, you will need to disable the console
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=getty&amp;sektion=8">getty(8)</a>
to use xdm(1).

<a name="CustomizingX"></a>
<h2>11.5 - Customizing X</h2>

<h3>11.5.1 - Introduction</h3>
OpenBSD's default X environment is fully functional, but you may wish to
customize it.
You may wish to change the background pattern or color, or you may wish
to change the Window Manager (the program that most defines your X
environment), or change the applications that are started when X starts.

<p>
The default window manager in OpenBSD is
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fvwm&amp;sektion=1">fvwm(1)</a>.
Fvwm is a good, general purpose window manager, but it is hardly your
only choice; it isn't even the only window manager included with OpenBSD
(see
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cwm&amp;sektion=1">cwm(1)</a>
and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=twm&amp;sektion=1">twm(1)</a>).
A large number of window managers are also available through
<a href="faq15.html">packages</a>.

<p>
Similar to the <a href="faq10.html#rc">system startup script</a>,
X has a process it goes through to set up the user environment.
More accurately, it has more than one process; which process is used
depends on how you <a href="#StartingX">start X</a>.
Understanding how X starts will help you understand how to customize
your work environment the way you wish it to be.

<p>
Note that you can customize the environment on both a system-wide and
user level.
It is probably best to do user level changes rather than to change the
system defaults, as the user scripts are stored in the user's home
directory, so you will have less merging of files to do when upgrading
to a new version of OpenBSD.

<!--XXX version -->
The system-wide defaults are in <tt>/etc/X11</tt> and were initially
loaded from <a href="faq4.html#FilesNeeded">xetcXX.tgz</a>, which is not
reloaded by the <a href="upgrade53.html">suggested upgrade process</a>,
so if you make system-wide changes, they will persist, but you may need
to merge those changes into later versions of those files.


<h3>11.5.2 - startx(1) startup</h3>
startx(1) looks for the file <tt>.xinitrc</tt> in the user's home
directory.
<tt>.xinitrc</tt> is usually a shell script, which can start as many
X "client" (applications that use X) programs as desired.
When this script exits, the X server shuts down.
Generally, most of the programs run by this script should run in the
background, though the last one should run in the foreground (typically
the window manager); when it exits, the script will exit, and X will be
shutdown.

<p>
In the simplest case, this can be as little as just the name of the
window manager you wish to invoke:

<blockquote><pre>
cwm
</pre></blockquote>

Or you can get a little more fancy:

<blockquote><pre>
xconsole -geometry -0+0 -fn 5x7 &
oclock -geometry 75x75-0-0 &
xsetroot -solid grey &
cwm
</pre></blockquote>

That will start the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=xconsole&amp;sektion=1">xconsole(1)</a>
which provides a copy of any text that the kernel would have sent to the
console (which is now covered by the graphical screen), an analog clock,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=oclock&amp;sektion=1">oclock(1)</a>,
and sets the background to a solid grey background with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=xsetroot&amp;sektion=1">xsetroot(1)</a>
all before invoking the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cwm&amp;sektion=1">cwm(1)</a>
window manager.
Note that only the window manager is not "backgrounded" with an "&amp;"
character.
This means that X will stay running until cwm(1) exits.

<p>
If a user's home directory does not have a <tt>.xinitrc</tt> file in it,  
the system's <tt>/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc</tt> file is used.
This file can provide you some additional ideas for your .xinitrc
script.


<h3>11.5.3 - xdm(1) startup</h3>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=xdm&amp;sektion=1">xdm(1)</a>
is usually started by the <a href="faq10.html#rc">system startup
scripts</a>, but for testing purposes (recommended, until you know your
have your X config right!), it can be run as root.

<p>
xdm(1) has a lot of other functionality that won't be touched on here,
but for our purposes, xdm will present the user with a login screen, get
and verify a user name and password, and then give the user their X
environment.
When X shuts down, either deliberately or accidently, xdm will start it   
back up again.
This is why you want to make sure X is configured properly before using
xdm(1), and certainly before having xdm(1) start at boot, otherwise, you
may have some difficulty getting control of the machine.

<p>
When xdm(1) starts, it runs the <tt>/etc/X11/xdm/Xsession</tt>, which
will check to see if the user has a <tt>.xsession</tt> file in their
home directory.
So, if you wish to change your default window manager, simply invoke it
(and maybe other things) in <tt>.xsession</tt>.
Again, any programs you want started with X (for example, maybe three
xterm(1)s) can be placed here, but all should be backgrounded except
for your window manager, as again, when that exits, your X session
will be ended.
In this case, xdm(1) will restart X and bring you back to a login
screen.

<h3>11.5.4 - Trying a new window manager</h3>
You can invoke a particular window manager when you load X without
altering any defaults like this:

<blockquote><pre>
$ startx /usr/local/bin/fluxbox
</pre></blockquote>

Several window managers (including cwm(1) and fvwm(1)) offer the ability
to change window managers on the fly, without restarting X or any of
your applications.
Your new window manager replaces your old one; exiting the newly-loaded
window manager terminates X, it does not return you back to your
previous window manager.
fvwm(1) allows you to start a different window manager by left clicking
on the background ("root window"), chose "(Re)Start", then pick your
preferred window manager (however, note that you will need to add
your alternative window managers to your <tt>.fvwmrc</tt> file (the
system-wide default is <tt>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm/.fvwmrc</tt>)).
cwm(1) allows you to invoke another window manager by hitting
Ctrl-Alt-w, and typing in the manager you wish to switch to.

<p>
Once you have found a window manager you like, you can set it as the final
program run by your startup scripts as described above.
