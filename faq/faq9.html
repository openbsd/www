<h2>9.1 - Simple tips for Linux (and other free Unix-like OS) users</h2>

<p>
There are several differences between OpenBSD and Linux. These
differences include but are not limited to, bootup procedure, network
interface usage and disk management. Most differences are well
documented, but involve searching manpages. This document tries to be an
index of those differences.

<p>
<ul>
   <li>OpenBSD has a <a href="../ports.html">ports tree</a>. This is to
   accommodate the fact that at this point not many applications are
   native to the OpenBSD environment.  This is both an attempt to get
   applications to work on OpenBSD for end-users and to get more
   applications made with OpenBSD in mind.  Eventually this ports tree
   is used to make a nice set of binary
   <a href="../ports.html#Get">packages</a>.
   <li>OpenBSD uses CVS for source changes.  With Linux, source code is
   disseminated through separate distributions.  OpenBSD pioneered
   anonymous CVS, which allows anyone to extract the full source tree
   for any version of OpenBSD (from 2.0 to current, and all revisions of
   all files in between) at any time! There is also a very convenient
   and easy to use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/">web
   interface to CVS</a>.
   <li>OpenBSD periodically releases snapshots for various architectures
   and makes a stable, official CD release every 6 months.
   <li>OpenBSD contains STRONG CRYPTO, which USA based OS's can't
   contain.  (See
   <a href= "../crypto.html">http://www.openbsd.org/crypto.html</a>)
   OpenBSD has also gone through heavy security auditing and many
   security features have already been implemented into the source tree.
   (IPSEC, KERBEROS).
   <li>OpenBSD's kernel is /bsd.
   <li>The names of hard disks are usually <i>/dev/wd</i> (IDE) and
   <i>/dev/sd</i> (SCSI or ATA devices emulating SCSI disks)
   <li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ifconfig&amp;sektion=8">/sbin/ifconfig</a>
   with no arguments in Linux gives the state of all the interfaces.
   Under OpenBSD you need the -a flag.
   <li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=route&amp;sektion=8">/sbin/route</a>
   with no arguments in Linux gives the state of all the active routes.
   Under OpenBSD you need the "<i>show</i>" parameter, or do a
   <b>netstat -r</b> (nice).
   <li>OpenBSD does NOT support Journaling Filesystems like ReiserFS,
   IBMs JFS or SGIs XFS. Instead we use
   <a href="faq14.html#SoftUpdates">Soft Updates</a>.
   <li>OpenBSD comes with Packet Filter (PF), not ipfw, ipchains, 
      netfilter, iptables, or ipf.  This means that:
<ul>
   <li>Network Address Tranlation (known as IP-Masquerading in Linux) is
   done through pfctl (using -N).
   (<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pfctl&amp;sektion=8">pfctl(8)</a>)
   <li>ipfwadm is done through pfctl.
   (<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pfctl&amp;sektion=8">pfctl(8)</a>,
   <a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf&amp;sektion=4">pf(4)</a>,
   <a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf.conf&amp;sektion=5">pf.conf(5)</a>)
   <li>You should look at <a href="faq6.html">section 6</a> for detailed
   configuration assistance and information.
</ul>
   <li>Interface address is stored in
   <a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hostname.if&amp;sektion=5">/etc/hostname.&lt;interfacename&gt;</a>.
   It can be a hostname instead of an IP address.
   <li>The machine name is in <i>/etc/myname</i>
   <li>The default gateway is in <i>/etc/mygate</i>
   <li>OpenBSD's default shell is /bin/sh, which is the Korn shell.
   Shells such as bash and tcsh can be added as packages or installed
   from the ports tree.
   <li>Password management changes a lot. The main files are different.
   (<a href=" http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=passwd&amp;sektion=1">passwd(1)</a>,
   <a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=passwd&amp;sektion=5">passwd(5)</a>)
   <li>Devices are named by driver, not by type. For example, there are
   no eth* devices. It would be ne0 for an ne2000 ethernet card, and xl0
   for a 3Com Etherlink XL and Fast Etherlink XL ethernet device, etc.
   <li>OpenBSD developers have made serious efforts to keep the manual
   pages up-to-date and accurate.  Use the
   <a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=man">man(1)</a>
   command to find information.
   </ul>

<a name= "DualBoot"></a>
<h2>9.2 - Dual booting Linux and OpenBSD</h2>

<p>
Yes! It is possible!

<p>
Read <a href= "ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/3.3/i386/INSTALL.linux">INSTALL.linux</a>.

<p>
<a name= "passwd"></a>
<h2>9.3 - Converting your Linux (or other System 7-style) password file
to BSD-style</h2>

<p>
First, figure out if your Linux password file is shadowed or not.  If it
is, grab <a href="http://www.openwall.com/john/">John the Ripper</a> and
use the unshadow utility that comes with it to merge your
<tt>passwd</tt> and <tt>shadow</tt> files into one System 7-style file.

<p>
Using your Linux password file, we'll call it <tt>linux_passwd</tt>, you
need to add in ::0:0 between fields four and seven.
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=awk&amp;sektion=1">awk(1)</a>
does this for you.

<blockquote>
<pre>
# <b>cat linux_passwd | awk -F : '{printf("%s:%s:%s:%s::0:0:%s:%s:%s\n",$1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$6,$7); }' &gt; new_passwd</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

At this point, you want to edit the <tt>new_passwd</tt> file and remove
the root and other system entries that are already present in your
OpenBSD password file or aren't applicable with OpenBSD (all of them).
Also, make sure there are no duplicate usernames or user IDs between
<tt>new_passwd</tt> and your OpenBSD box's <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>.  The
easiest way to do this is to start with a fresh <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>.

<blockquote>
<pre>
# <b>cat new_passwd &gt;&gt; /etc/master.passwd</b>
# <b>pwd_mkdb -p /etc/master.passwd</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

The last step, <tt>pwd_mkdb</tt> is necessary to rebuild the
/etc/spwd.db and /etc/pwd.db files.  It also creates a System 7-style
password file (minus encrypted passwords) at /etc/passwd for programs
which use it.  OpenBSD uses a stronger encryption for passwords,
blowfish, which is very unlikely to be found on any system which uses
full System 7-style password files.  To switch over to this stronger
encryption, simply have the users run 'passwd' and change their
password.  The new password they enter will be encrypted with your
default setting (usually blowfish unless you've edited
/etc/login.conf).  Or, as root, you can run <tt>passwd
<i>username</i></tt>.

<a name= "Interact"></a>
<h2>9.4 - Getting OpenBSD and Linux to interact</h2>

<p>
If you are migrating from Linux to OpenBSD, note that OpenBSD has
COMPAT_LINUX enabled by default in the GENERIC kernel.  To run any Linux
binaries that are not statically linked (most of them), you need to
follow the instructions on the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=compat_linux&amp;sektion=8">compat_linux(8)</a> 
manual page.  A simple way to get most of the useful Linux libraries is
to install the <tt>redhat/base</tt> port from your ports collection. To
find out more about the Ports collection read
<a href="faq8.html#Ports">FAQ 8 - Ports</a>. If you already have the
ports tree installed, use these commands to get Linux libraries
installed.

<blockquote>
<pre>
# <strong>cd /usr/ports/emulators/redhat/base</strong>
# <strong>make install</strong>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
OpenBSD supports the EXT2FS file system.  Use
<b><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&amp;sektion=8">disklabel (8)</a> 
<i>disk</i></b> (where <b><i>disk</i></b> is the device name for your
disk.) to see what OpenBSD thinks your Linux partition is (but
<strong>don't</strong> use disklabel or fdisk to make any changes to
it). For further information on using disklabel read
<a href="faq14.html#disklabel">FAQ 14 - Disklabel</a>.
