<h2>10.1 - Why does it say that I'm in the wrong group when I try to su root?</h2>
</p>

<p>
Existing users must be added to
the <kbd>&quot;wheel&quot;</kbd> group by hand. This is done for security reasons, and you should be cautious with whom you give
access to. On OpenBSD, users who are in the <kbd>wheel</kbd> group are allowed to use the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=su&apropos=0&sektion=1&format=html">
su(1)</a> userland program to become root. Users who are not in <kbd>&quot;wheel&quot;</kbd> cannot use su(1). Here is
an example of a <kbd>/etc/group</kbd> entry to place the user <strong>ericj</strong> into the
<kbd>&quot;wheel&quot;</kbd> group.
<P>
If you are adding a new user with <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adduser&apropos=0&sektion=8&format=html">adduser(8)</a>,
you can put them in the wheel
group by answering wheel at <tt>Invite <i>user</i> into other groups:</tt>
This will add them to /etc/group, which will look something like this:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
wheel:*:0:root,ericj
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
If you are looking for a way to allow users limited access to superuser privileges, without putting them in the
<kbd>&quot;wheel&quot;</kbd> group, use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sudo&sektion=8&format=html">sudo(8)</a>.
</p>

<h2>10.2 - How do I duplicate a filesystem?</h2>
</p>

<p>
To duplicate your filesystem use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dump&sektion=8&format=html">dump(8)</a> and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=restore&sektion=8&format=html">restore(8)</a>. For example. To duplicate
everything under directory <kbd>SRC</kbd> to directory <kbd>DST</kbd>, do a:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
# <strong>cd /SRC; dump 0f - . | (cd /DST; restore -rf - )</strong>
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
dump is designed to give you plenty of backup capabilities, and it may be an overkill
if you just want to duplicate a part of a (or an entire) filesystem.
The command <A 
HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tar&sektion=1&format=html">tar(1)</a>
may be faster for this operation.  The format looks very similar:
<UL>
<PRE>
# <strong>cd /SRC; tar cf -  . | (cd /DST; tar xpf - )</strong>
</PRE>
</UL>

<h2>10.3 - How do I start daemons with the system? ( Overview of rc(8) )</h2>
</p>

<p>
OpenBSD uses an <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rc&sektion=8&format=html">rc(8)</a> style
startup. This uses a few key files for startup.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>/etc/rc - Main script. Should not be edited.
	<li>/etc/rc.conf - Configuration file used by <i>/etc/rc</i> to know what daemons should start with the
	system.
	<li>/etc/netstart - Script used to initialize the network. Shouldn't be edited.
	<li>/etc/rc.local - Script used for local administration. This is where new daemons or host specific
	information should be stored.
	<li>/etc/rc.securelevel - Script which runs commands that must be run before the security level
	changes. See <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=init&sektion=8&format=html">init(8)</a>
	<li>/etc/rc.shutdown - Script run on shutdown. Put anything you want done before shutdown in this file.
	See <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rc.shutdown&sektion=8&format=html">rc.shutdown(8)</a>
</ul>

<h3>How does rc(8) work?</h3>
<p>
The main files a system administrator should concentrate on are <i>/etc/rc.conf</i>, <i>/etc/rc.local</i> and
<i>/etc/rc.shutdown</i>. To get a look of how the rc(8) procedure works, here is a the flow:
</p>

<ul>After the kernel is booted. <i>/etc/rc</i> is started.
	<li>Filesystems checked. This will always be bypassed if the file /etc/fastboot exists. This is
	certainly not a good idea though.
	<li>Configuration Variables are read in from <i>/etc/rc.conf</i>
	<li>Filesystems are mounted
	<li>Clears out <i>/tmp</i> and preserves any editor files
	<li>Configures the network via <i>/etc/netstart</i>
		<ul>
		<li>Configures your interfaces up.
		<li>Sets your hostname, domainname, etc.
		</ul>
	<li>Starts system daemons
	<li>Does various checks. (quota's, savecore, etc)
	<li>Local daemons are run, ala <i>/etc/rc.local</i>
</ul>

<h3>Starting Daemons and Services that come with OpenBSD</h3>

<p>
Most daemons and services that come with OpenBSD by default can be started on boot by simply editing the
<i>/etc/rc.conf</i> configuration file. To start out take a look at the default 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/etc/rc.conf">/etc/rc.conf</a> file. You'll see lines similar
to this:
</p>

<ul><pre>
ftpd_flags=NO           # for non-inetd use: ftpd_flags="-D"
</pre></ul>

<p>
A line like this shows that ftpd is not starting up with the system. ( At least not via rc(8), read the
<a href="faq10.html#AnonFTP">Anonymous FTP FAQ</a> to read more about this. ) In any case, each line also has a
comment showing you the flags for <b>NORMAL</b> usage of that daemon or service. This doesn't mean that you
must run that daemon or service with those flags. You can always use man(1) to see how you can have that
daemon or service start up in any way you like. For example, Here is the default line pertaining to httpd(8).
</p>

<ul><pre>
httpd_flags=NO          # for normal use: "" (or "-DSSL" after reading ssl(8))
</pre></ul>

<p>
Here you can obviously see that starting up httpd normally no flags are necessary. So a line like: &quot;<b>
httpd_flags=""</b>&quot; would be necessary. But to start httpd with ssl enabled. (Refer to the 
<a href="#HTTPS">SSL FAQ</a> or <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssl&sektion=8&format=html">ssl(8)</a>)
You should start with a line like: &quot;httpd_flags="-DSSL"&quot;.
</p>

<h3>Starting up local daemons and configuration</h3>

<p>
For other daemons that you might install with the system via ports or other ways, you will use the
<i>/etc/rc.local</i> file. For example, I've installed a daemon which lies at /usr/local/sbin/daemonx. I
want this to start at boot time. I would put an entry into <i>/etc/rc.local</i> like this:
</p>

<ul><pre>
if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/daemonx ]; then
             echo -n ' daemonx';       /usr/local/sbin/daemonx
fi
</pre></ul>

<p>
From now on, this daemon will be run at boot. You will be able to see any errors on boot, a normal boot with no
errors would show a line like this:
</p>

<ul><pre>
Starting local daemons: daemonx.
</pre></ul>

<h3>rc.shutdown</h3>

<p>
<i>/etc/rc.shutdown</i> is a script that is run a shutdown. Anything you want done before the system shuts down
should be added to this file. If you have apm, you can also set &quot;powerdown=YES&quot;. Which will give you
the equivalent of &quot;shutdown -p&quot;.
</p>

<a name= "RelayingDenied"></a>
<a name="10.4"></a>
<h2>10.4 - Why do users get relaying access denied when they are remotely sending mail through my OpenBSD system?</h2>
</p>

<p>
Try this:
</p>
<ul>
<pre>
# <strong>cat /etc/mail/sendmail.cf | grep relay-domains</strong>
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
The output may look something like this:
</p>
<ul>
<pre>
FR-o /etc/mail/relay-domains
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
If this file doesn't exist, create it.  You will need to enter the hosts
who are sending mail remotely with the following syntax:
</p>
<ul>
<pre>
.domain.com    #Allow relaying for/to any host in domain.com
sub.domain.com #Allow relaying for/to sub.domain.com and any host in that domain
10.2           #Allow relaying from all hosts in the IP net 10.2.*.*
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
Don't forget send a 'HangUP' signal to sendmail, (a signal which
causes most daemons to re-read their configuration file):

</p>
<ul><pre>
# <Strong>kill -HUP `head -1 /var/run/sendmail.pid`</strong>
</pre></ul>
<p>

<a name= "POP"></a>
<a name="10.5"></a>
<h2>10.5 - I've set up POP, but users have trouble accessing mail through POP. What can I do?</h2>
</p>

<p>
Most issues dealing with POP are problems with temporary files and lock files.
If your pop server sends an error message such as:
</p>
<ul>
<pre>
-ERR Couldn't open temporary file, do you own it?
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
Try setting up your permissions as such:
<ul>
<pre>
permission in  /var
drwxrwxr-x   2 bin     mail     512 May 26 20:08 mail


permissions in  /var/mail
-rw-------   1 username   username        0 May 26 20:08 username
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
Another thing to check is that the user actually owns their own /var/mail file.
Of course this should be the case (as in, /var/mail/joe should be owned by joe)
but if it isn't set correctly it could be the problem!
<P>
Of course, making /var/mail writable by group mail opens up some vague and
obscure security problems.  It is likely that you will never have problems
with it.  But it could (especially if you are a high profile site, ISP,...)!
Try running cucipop or another POP daemon from the OpenBSD ports collection.
Or, you could just have the wrong options selected for your pop daemon
(like dot locking).  Or, you may just need to change the directory
that it locks in (although then the locking would only be valuable for the
POP daemon.)
</p>

<p>
<b>PS:</b> Notice, OpenBSD does not have a group name of &quot;mail&quot;. You need to create this in your <i>/etc/group</i> file. An entry like:

<ul><pre>
mail:*:6:
</pre></ul>

would be sufficient.
</p>

<p>
<a name= "HTTPS"></a>
<a name="10.6"></a>
<h2>10.6 - Setting up a Secure HTTP server with SSL(8)</h2>
</p>

<p>
Starting with OpenBSD 2.8, OpenBSD ships with an SSL-ready httpd and RSA libraries. However, if you are using OpenBSD 2.6 or 2.7 you must use provided SSL packages to use SSL. For more information, <b>man 8 ssl</b>.
</p>

<p>
For use with <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=httpd&sektion=8&format=html">httpd(8)</a>, you must first have a certificate created. This will be kept in <i>/etc/ssl/private/</i>. The steps shown here are taken in part from the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssl&sektion=8&format=html">ssl(8)</a> man page. Refer to it for further information. This FAQ entry only outlines how to create an RSA certificate for web servers, not a
DSA server certificate. To find out how to do so, please refer to the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssl&sektion=8&format=html">ssl(8)</a> man page. 
</p> 

<p>
To start off, you need to create your server key and certificate. To use the RSA features, you must have upgraded your libssl. Now you can create your key. Using OpenSSL:
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<pre>
# <strong>openssl genrsa -out /etc/ssl/private/server.key 1024</strong>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Or, if you wish the key to be encrypted with a passphrase that you will
have to type in when starting servers
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<pre>
# <strong>openssl genrsa -des3 -out /etc/ssl/private/server.key 1024</strong>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The next step is to generate a Certificate Signing Request which is used
to get a Certifying Authority (CA) to sign your certificate. To do this
use the command:
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<pre>
# <strong>openssl req -new -key /etc/ssl/private/server.key -out /etc/ssl/private/server.csr</strong>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This <i>server.csr</i> file can then be given to Certifying Authority who will
sign the key. One such CA is <b>Thawte Certification</b> which you can reach at
<a href="http://www.thawte.com/">http://www.thawte.com/</a>. Thawte can currently sign RSA keys for you. A
procedure is being worked out to allow for DSA keys.
</p>

<p>
If you cannot afford this, or just want to sign the certificate yourself, you can use the following.
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<pre>
# <strong>openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in /etc/ssl/private/server.csr \
       -signkey /etc/ssl/private/server.key -out /etc/ssl/server.crt</strong>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
With <i>/etc/ssl/server.crt</i> and <i>/etc/ssl/private/server.key</i> in place, you
should be able to start <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=httpd&sektion=8&format=html">httpd(8)</a> with the <b>-DSSL</b> flag, enabling https
transactions with your machine on port 443.
</p>

<h2>10.7 - I edited /etc/passwd, but the changes didn't seem to take place. Why?</h2>
</p>

<p>
If you edit /etc/passwd, your changes will be lost.  OpenBSD
generates /etc/passwd dynamically with <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pwd_mkdb&sektion=8&apropos=0">pwd_mkdb(8)</a>.  The main password
file in OpenBSD is /etc/master.passwd.  According to pwd_mkdb(8),
<ul>
<pre>
FILES
     /etc/master.passwd  current password file
     /etc/passwd         a Version 7 format password file
     /etc/pwd.db         insecure password database file
     /etc/pwd.db.tmp     temporary file
     /etc/spwd.db        secure password database file
     /etc/spwd.db.tmp    temporary file
</pre>
</ul>
<P>
In a traditional Unix password file, such as /etc/passwd, everything
including the user's encrypted password is available to anyone on the
system (and is a prime target for programs such as Crack.)  4.4BSD
introduces the master.passwd file, which has an extended format (with
additional options beyond what was provided by /etc/passwd) and is only
readable by root.  For faster access to data, the library calls which
access this data normally read /etc/pwd.db and /etc/spwd.db.
<P>
OpenBSD does come with a tool with which you should edit your password file.
It is called vipw(8).  Vipw will use vi (or your favourite editor defined
per $EDITOR) to edit /etc/master.passwd.  After you are done editing, it will
re-create /etc/passwd, /etc/pwd.db, and /etc/spwd.db as per your changes.
Vipw also takes care of locking these files, so that if anyone else attempts
to change them at the same time, they will be denied access.

<h2>10.8 - What is the best way to add and delete users?</h2>
</p>

<p>
For OpenBSD 2.6 users, the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adduser&sektion=8&format=html">adduser(8)</a> command is available for adding users. In OpenBSD 2.7, the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=user&sektion=8&format=html">user(8)</a> command was added to deal with adding and removing both users and groups.

<ul>
	<li><a href="#adduser">adduser(8)</a>
	<li><a href="#user">user(8)</a>
</ul>

<a name="adduser"></a>
<p>
The best way to add a user in OpenBSD is to use the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adduser&sektion=8&format=html">adduser(8)</a>
script. You can configure this to work however you like by editing
<strong>/etc/adduser.conf</strong>. You can add users by hand via <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vipw&sektion=8&format=html">vipw(8)</a>, but this is
the recommended way to add users. adduser(8) allows for consistency checks
on <strong>/etc/passwd</strong>, <strong>/etc/group</strong>, and shell
databases. It will create the entries and $HOME directories for you. It can
even send a message to the user welcoming them. This can be changed to
meet your needs. Here is an example user, <b>testuser</b> being added to a
system. His/Her $HOME directory will be placed in <i>/home/testuser</i>, 
and given the group <b>guest</b>, and the shell <i>/bin/ksh</i>.
</p>

<ul><pre>
# <strong>adduser</strong>
Use option ``-silent'' if you don't want to see all warnings and questions.

Reading /etc/shells
Check /etc/master.passwd
Check /etc/group

Ok, let's go.
Don't worry about mistakes. I will give you the chance later to correct any input.
Enter username [a-z0-9_]: <strong>testuser</strong>
Enter full name []: <strong>Test FAQ User</strong>
Enter shell csh ksh nologin sh [ksh]: <strong>ksh</strong>
Uid [1002]: <strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong>
Login group testuser [testuser]: <strong>guest</strong>
Login group is ``guest''. Invite testuser into other groups: guest no
[no]: <strong>no</strong>
Enter password []: 
Enter password again []:

Name:     testuser
Password: ****
Fullname: Test FAQ User
Uid:      1002
Gid:      31 (guest)
Groups:   guest
HOME:     /home/testuser
Shell:    /bin/ksh
OK? (y/n) [y]: <strong>y</strong>
Added user ``testuser''
Copy files from /usr/share/skel to /home/testuser
Add another user? (y/n) [y]: <strong>n</strong>
Goodbye!
</pre></ul>

<p>
To delete users you should use the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rmuser&sektion=8&format=html">rmuser(8)</a>
utility. This will remove all existence of a user. It will remove any
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=crontab&sektion=1&format=html">crontab(1)</a> entries, their $HOME dir (if it is owned by the user), and their mail.
Of course it will also remove their <strong>/etc/passwd</strong> and <strong>/etc/group</strong>
entries. Next is an example of removing the user that was added above. Notice you are prompted for the name, and whether or not to remove the users home directory.
</p>

<ul><pre>
# <strong>rmuser</strong>
Enter login name for user to remove: <strong>testuser</strong>
Matching password entry:

testuser:$2a$07$ZWnBOsbqMJ.ducQBfsTKUe3PL97Ve1AHWJ0A4uLamniLNXLeYrEie:1002:31::0:0:Test FAQ User:/home/testuser:/bin/ksh

Is this the entry you wish to remove? <strong>y</strong>
Remove user's home directory (/home/testuser)? <strong>y</strong>
Updating password file, updating databases, done.
Updating group file: done.
Removing user's home directory (/home/testuser): done.
</pre></ul>

<a name="user"></a>
<h3>10.8.2 - Adding users via user(8)</h3>
<p>
Starting in the 2.7 release of OpenBSD, many commands were added for dealing with users and groups. These tools are less interactive than the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adduser&sektion=8&format=html">adduser(8)</a> command, which helps facilitate using these in a script. 
</p>

<ul>A list of the added commands are:
	<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=group&sektion=8&format=html">group(8)</a>
	<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=groupadd&sektion=8&format=html">groupadd(8)</a>
	<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=groupdel&sektion=8&format=html">groupdel(8)</a>
	<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=groupinfo&sektion=8&format=html">groupinfo(8)</a>
	<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=groupmod&sektion=8&format=html">groupmod(8)</a>
	<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=user&sektion=8&format=html">user(8)</a>
	<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=useradd&sektion=8&format=html">useradd(8)</a>
	<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=userdel&sektion=8&format=html">userdel(8)</a>
	<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=userinfo&sektion=8&format=html">userinfo(8)</a>
	<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=usermod&sektion=8&format=html">usermod(8)</a>
</ul>

<h4>10.8.2.1 - Actually adding users</h4>

<p>
Being that user(8) is not interactive, the easiest way to add users efficiently is to use the adduser(8) command. The actual command <i>/usr/sbin/user</i> is just a frontend to the rest of the <i>/usr/sbin/user*</i> commands. Therefore, the following commands can be added by using <b>user add</b> or <b>useradd</b>, its your choice as to what you want, and doesn't change the use of the commands at all.
</p>

<p>
In this example, we are adding the same user with the same specifications as the user that was added <a href="#adduser">above</a>. useradd(8) is much easier to use if you know the default setting before adding a user. These settings are located in <i>/etc/usermgmt.conf</i> and can be viewed by doing so:
</p>

<ul><pre>
$ <strong>user add -D</strong>
group           users
base_dir        /home
skel_dir        /etc/skel
shell           /bin/csh
inactive        0
expire          Null (unset)
range           1000..60000
</pre></ul>

<p>
The above settings are what will be set unless you specify different with command line options. For example, in our case, we want the user to go to the group <b>guest</b>, not <b>users</b>. One more little hurdle with adding users, is that passwords must be specified on the commandline. This is, the encrypted passwords, so you must first use the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=encrypt&sektion=1&format=html">encrypt(1)</a> utility to create the password. For example: OpenBSD's passwords by default use the Blowfish algorithm for 6 rounds. Here is an example line to create an encrypted password to specify to useradd(8).
</p>

<ul><pre>
$ <strong>encrypt -p -b 6</strong>
Enter string:
$2a$06$YOdOZM3.4m6MObBXjeZtBOWArqC2.uRJZXUkOghbieIvSWXVJRzlq
</pre></ul>

<p>
Now that we have our encrypted password, we are ready to add the user.
</p>

<ul><pre>
# <strong>user add -p '$2a$06$YOdOZM3.4m6MObBXjeZtBOWArqC2.uRJZXUkOghbieIvSWXVJRzlq' -u 1002 \
-s /bin/ksh -c "Test FAQ User" -m -g guest testuser</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Make sure to use '' around the password string, not &quot;&quot; as the shell will interpret these before sending it to user(8). In addition to that, make sure you specify the <b>-m</b> option if you want the user's home directory created and the files from <i>/etc/skel</i> copied over.
</p>

<p>
To see that the user was created correctly, we can use many different utilities. Below are a few commands you can use to quickly check that everything was created correctly.
</p>

<ul><pre>
$ <strong>ls -la /home</strong>
total 14
drwxr-xr-x   5 root      wheel   512 May 12 14:29 .

No Mail.
No Plan.
</pre></ul>

<p>
In addition to these commands, user(8) provides its own utility to show user characteristics, called userinfo(8).
</p>

<ul><pre>
$ <strong>userinfo testuser</strong>
login   testuser
passwd  *
uid     1002
groups  guest

</pre></ul>

<h4>10.8.2.2 - Removing users</h4>

<p>
To remove users with the user(8) hierarchy of commands, you will use userdel(8). This is a very simple, yet usable command. To remove the user created in the last example, simply:
</p>

<ul><pre>
# <strong>userdel -r testuser</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
Notice the <b>-r</b> option, which must be specified if you want the users home directory to be deleted as well. Alternatively, you can specify <b>-p</b> and not <b>-r</b> and this will lock the user's account, but not remove any information.
</p>

<p>
<a name= "FTPOnly"></a>
<a name="10.9"></a>
<h2>10.9 - How do I create an ftp-only account (not anonymous FTP!)?</h2>
</p>

<p>
There are a few ways to do this, but a very common way to do such is to
add <i>/usr/bin/false</i> into <strong>/etc/shells</strong>. Then when you create
the user set his shell to /usr/bin/false, they will not be able log in
interactively, but will be able to use ftp capabilities. <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adduser&sektion=8&format=html">adduser(8)</a>
will give them a home dir by default of <i>/home/&lt;user&gt;</i>. If this is what you
desire it doesn't need to be changed, however you can set this to whatever
directory you wish.  You can force this user to only be able to
see files in their home directory by adding their username to <i>/etc/ftpchroot</i>.
Using the <b>-A</b> option to <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftpd&sektion=8&format=html">ftpd(8)</a>, you can allow only ftpchroot logins!
</p>

<p>
<a name= "Quotas"></a>
<a name="10.10"></a>
<h2>10.10 - Setting up Quotas</h2>
</p>

<p>
Quotas are used to limit users space that they have available to them on
your drives. It can be very helpful in situations where you have limited resources.
Quotas can be set in two different ways. 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>User Quotas</li>
<li>Group Quotas</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The first step to setting up quotas is to make sure that <tt>option
QUOTA</tt> is in your Kernel Configuration. This option is in the
GENERIC kernel. After this you need to mark in <i>/etc/fstab</i>
the filesystems which will have quotas enabled. The keywords
<tt>userquota</tt> and <tt>groupquota</tt> should be used
to mark each fs that you will be using quotas on. By default the files
<tt>quota.user</tt> and <tt>quota.group</tt> will be
created at the root of that filesystem to hold the quota information. This
default can be overwritten by doing, userquota=/var/quotas/quota.user. Or
whatever file you want to use for holding quota information. Here is an
example /etc/fstab that has one filesystem with userquotas enabled.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
/dev/wd0a / ffs rw,userquota=/var/quotas/quota.user 1 1
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Now it's time to set the user's quotas. To do so you use the utility
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=edquota&sektion=8&format=html">edquota(8)</a>.
A simple use is just <strong>edquota &lt;user&gt;</strong>. edquota(8)
will use vi(1) to edit the quotas unless the environmental variable
EDITOR is set to a different editor. For example:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
# <strong>edquota ericj</strong>
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
This will give you output similar to this:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
Quotas for user ericj:
/: blocks in use: 62, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)
	inodes in use: 25, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
To add limits, edit it to give results like this:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
Quotas for user ericj:
/: blocks in use: 62, limits (soft = 1000, hard = 1050)
	inodes in use: 25, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
In this the softlimit is set to 1000 blocks and the hardlimit is set to
1050 blocks. A softlimit is a limit where the user is just warned when
they cross it and have until their grace period is up to get their disk
usage below their limit. Grace periods can be set by using the
<strong>-t</strong> option on edquota(8). After the grace period is over
the softlimit is handled as a hardlimit. This usually results in an
allocation failure.
</p>

<p>
Now that the quotas are set, you need to turn the quotas on. To do
this use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=quotaon&sektion=8&format=html">quotaon(8)</a>.
For example:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
# <strong>quotaon -a</strong>
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
This will go through /etc/fstab to turn on the filesystems with quota
options. Now that quotas are up and running, you can view them by
the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=quota&sektion=1&format=html">quota(1)</a>.
Using a command of <strong>quota &lt;user&gt;</strong> will give that users
information. When called with no arguments the quota command will give your quota statistics. For
example:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
# <Strong>quota ericj</strong>
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Will result in output similar to this:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
Disk quotas for user ericj (uid 1001): 
     Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
              /      62    1000    1050              27       0       0        
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
By default quotas set in /etc/fstab will be started on boot. To turn them
off use
<ul><pre># <strong>quotaoff -a</strong></pre></ul>
</p>

<h2>10.11 - How to Setup Kerberos Clients and Servers under OpenBSD</h2>
</p>

<p>
As a user/administrator of OpenBSD systems, you are fortunate that
KerberosIV is an pre-installed component of the default system. Here is
a guide to setting up both the Kerberos realm server, as well as a
client.
</p>

<p>
An *EXTREMELY* important point to remember is that Kerberos clients
and servers must have their system clocks synchronized. If there is
more than a 5 minute time skew, you will receive weird errors that
do not immediately reveal themselves to be caused by time skew, such as:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
kinit: Can't send request (send_to_kdc) 
</pre>
</ul>

Another more accurate error is:

<ul>
<pre>
kauth: Time is out of bounds (krb_rd_req) 
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
An easy way to synchronize system clocks is with ntpd, available in the ports tree at
<strong>/usr/ports/net/ntp/</strong>.
</p>

This FAQ entry assumes you have prior knowledge of the Kerberos concepts.

<h3>How to setup the Kerberos IV REALM and SERVER</h3>

<p>
We will be setting up the CIARASYSTEMS.COM realm, with avalanche.ciarasystems.com as the main server.
</p>

<p>
To start off, we will need to edit our configuration files. These files are located at <tt>/etc/kerberosIV/</tt>.
The two files we are concerned about are <i>krb.realms</i> and <i>krb.conf</i>. Let's start off with <i>krb.conf</i>.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
[root@avalanche kerberosIV] <strong>cat krb.conf</strong>
CIARASYSTEMS.COM
CIARASYSTEMS.COM avalanche.ciarasystems.com admin server
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
As you can see, this tells kerberos that the domain is CIARASYSTEMS.COM (or logical realm) and that
within that domain, avalanche is the administration server. Next we will look at <i>krb.realms</i>. For more information
on this refer to <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=krb.conf&sektion=5&format=html">krb.conf</a>.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
[root@avalanche kerberosIV] <strong>cat krb.realms</strong>
avalanche.ciarasystems.com      CIARASYSTEMS.COM
.ciarasystems.com               CIARASYSTEMS.COM
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
krb.realms provides a translation from a hostname to the Kerberos realm name for the services provided by that host.
Each line of the translation file is in one of the following forms (domain_name should be  of  the  form  .XXX.YYY).
So in this example, avalanche is the hostname of a computer on the CIARASYSTEMS.COM realm. And
.ciarasystems.com is the domain name on the realm CIARASYSTEMS.COM. Again, for further information read
the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=krb.realms&sektion=5&format=html">krb.realms</a>. man page.
</p>

<p>
Next we will run <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=kdb_init&sektion=8&format=html">kdb_init(8)</a> 
to create the initial Kerberos database.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
[root@avalanche kerberosIV] <strong>kdb_init</strong>
Realm name [default  NO.DEFAULT.REALM ]: CIARASYSTEMS.COM
You will be prompted for the database Master Password.
It is important that you NOT FORGET this password.

Enter Kerberos master password: <strong>not shown</strong>
Verifying password -
Enter Kerberos master password:
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Next we need to use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=kstash&sektion=8&format=html">kstash(8)</a> 
which is used to save the Kerberos key distribution center (KDC) database master key in the master key cache file.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
[root@avalanche kerberosIV] <strong>kstash</strong>
Enter Kerberos master password:

Current Kerberos master key version is 1.

Master key entered.  BEWARE!
Wrote master key to /etc/kerberosIV/master_key
</pre>
This saves the encrypted master password in /etc/kerberosIV/master_key.<p>

Next, we need two principals to be added to the database for each
system that will be secured with Kerberos. Their names are
<i>kpasswd</i> and <i>rcmd</i>. These two principals are made for
each system, with the instance being the name of the individual system. 

These daemons, <i>kpasswd</i> and <i>rcmd</i> allow other systems
to change Kerberospasswords and run commands like <i>rcp, rlogin</i> 
and <i>rsh</i>. 


<pre>
# <b>kdb_edit</b>

Enter Kerberos master key:

Principal name:               <strong>&lt;----- Hit &lt;ENTER&gt; to end</strong>

</pre>
</ul>

<p>
A srvtab file is the service key file. These must be extracted from the  Kerberos key  distribution center database in
order for services to authenticate using Kerberos. For  each  hostname  specified  on
the command line, <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ext_srvtab&sektion=8&format=html">ext_srvtab(8)</a>
creates the service key file hostname-new-srvtab, containing all the entries in the database with an instance field of
hostname.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
[root@avalanche kerberosIV] <Strong>ext_srvtab avalanche</strong>

Enter Kerberos master password:

Current Kerberos master key version is 1.

[root@avalanche kerberosIV] <strong>mv avalanche-new-srvtab srvtab</strong>
[root@avalanche kerberosIV] <strong>chmod 600 srvtab</strong>

</ul>

<p>
Now we can add users to our database.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
[root@avalanche kerberosIV] <strong>kdb_edit</strong>

Enter Kerberos master key:

Edit O.K.
Principal name:          &lt;---- null entry here will cause an exit
			       or you can add more entries.
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
So now all the Kerberos particulars are setup. All that is left is to enable
boot-time loading of the Kerberos server and to enable Kerberized-daemons.
</p>

<p>
In /etc/rc.conf, set:
<ul>
<tt>kerberos_server=YES</tt>
</ul>

In /etc/inetd.conf, uncomment:
<UL>
<pre>
telnet       stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/telnetd    telnetd -k
klogin       stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/rlogind    rlogind -k
kshell       stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/rshd       rshd -k
kauth        stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/kauthd     kauthd
</pre>
</ul>

Then, either reboot, or:
<ul>
<pre>
[root@avalanche /] <Strong>kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`</strong>
[root@avalanche /] <Strong>/usr/libexec/kerberos >> /var/log/kerberos.log &</strong>
[root@avalanche /] <strong>/usr/libexec/kadmind -n >> /var/log/kadmind.log &</strong>
</pre>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Note: this is a rather simple server setup. Usually, redundant servers
are setup (as slave servers) so that if one server goes down, all the
services that depend on Kerberos don't go down. We can also add 'su'
privileges to a specific principal, see 
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kerberos.html#AEN9189">the FreeBSD Handbook</a>.
</p>

<h3>How to kerberize your client workstation</h3>

<p>
We will be setting the workstation named <i>gatekeeper</i> to be in the
CIARASYSTEMS.COM realm, with avalanche.ciarasystems.com as the main server.
</p>

<p>
To start off, we need to setup our <i>krb.conf</i> and <i>krb.realms</i> like the above machine. This is so
<i>gatekeeper</i> will know what server is the KDC and what domain it is on. Again here are the file contents.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
[root@gatekeeper kerberosIV] <strong>cat krb.conf</strong>
CIARASYSTEMS.COM
CIARASYSTEMS.COM avalanche.ciarasystems.com admin server

[root@gatekeeper kerberosIV] <strong>cat krb.realms</strong>
avalanche.ciarasystems.com      CIARASYSTEMS.COM
.ciarasystems.com               CIARASYSTEMS.COM
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Now that is set up, we need to initialize kerberos. To obtain a ticket you use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=kinit&sektion=1&format=html">kinit(1)</a>.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
xyz:jeremie% <Strong>kinit</strong>
The OpenBSD Project (gatekeeper)
Kerberos Initialization
Kerberos name: <strong>jeremie</strong>
Password:
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Now we have identified we can list our tickets with <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=klist&sektion=1&format=html">klist(1)</a>.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
xyz:jeremie$ <strong>klist</strong>
Ticket file:    /tmp/tkt1000

</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Looks like we are set now. All that's left to do is test it. Here we will test it with rlogin(1) and telnet(1).
</p>

<ul>
<pre>

<p>
We can tell that it is indeed using Kerberos to authenticate the rlogin
session. To get rid of any tickets issued, you would use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=kdestroy&sektion=1&format=html">kdestroy(1)</a>.
For example:
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
xyz:jeremie% <strong>kdestroy</strong>
Tickets destroyed.
xyz:jeremie% <Strong>rlogin avalanche</strong>
krcmd: No ticket file (tf_util)
rlogin: warning, using standard rlogin: can't provide Kerberos auth data.
avalanche: Connection refused
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
Do not worry about 'Warning: no Kerberos tickets issued.' This is because
we're only doing kerberos authentication, not ticket passing. If you want
ticket passing, use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&sektion=1&format=html">OpenSSH</a> which has support.
Stock KerberosIV  doesn't have support for tgt passing, either - only the AFS kaserver's implementation of krb4,
since the regular KerberosIV kdc checks client IP address listed in the ticket.

<a name= "AnonFTP"></a>
<a name="10.12"></a>
<h2>10.12 - Setting up Anonymous FTP Services.</h2>
</p>

<p>
Anonymous FTP allows users without accounts to access files on your computer via the File Transfer Protocol. This
will give an overview of setting up the anonymous FTP server, and its logging, etc. 
</p>

<h3>Adding the FTP account</h3>

<p>
To start off, you need to have an account on your system of "ftp". This account shouldn't have a usable
password.  Here we will set the login directory to /home/ftp, but
you can put it wherever you want. When using anonymous ftp, the ftp daemon will
chroot itself to the home directory of the 'ftp' user. To read up more on that, read the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftpd&sektion=8&format=html">ftp(8)</a> and 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=chroot&sektion=2&format=html">chroot(2)</a> man pages. Here
is an example of adding the <i>ftp</i> user. I will do this using <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adduser&sektion=8&format=html">adduser(8)</a>.
We also need to add /usr/bin/false to our <i>/etc/shells</i>, this is the &quot;shell&quot; that we will be giving to
the ftp user. This won't allow them to login, even though we will give them an empty password. To do this you
can simply <i>echo /usr/bin/false &gt;&gt; /etc/shells</i>. Also if you wish for that shell to show up during the adduser
questions, you need to modify <i>/etc/adduser.conf</i>.
</p>


<ul>
<pre>
oshibana# <strong>adduser</strong>

</ul>

<h3>Directory Setup</h3>

<p>
Along with the user, this created the directory <i>/home/ftp</i>. This is what we want, but there are some
changes that we will have to make to get it ready for anonymous ftp. Again these changes are explained in the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftpd&sektion=8&format=html">ftp(8)</a> man page.
</p>

<ul>
You <b>do not</b> need to make a /home/ftp/usr or /home/ftp/bin directory.
<BR>
<li><i>/home/ftp</i> - This is the main directory. It should be owned by root and have permissions of 555.</li>
<li><i>/home/ftp/etc</i> - This is entirely optional and not recommended, as it only serves to give out information on users which exist on your box.  If you want your anonymous ftp directory to appear to have real users attached to your files, you should copy /etc/pwd.db and /etc/group to this
directory. This directory should be mode 511, and the two files should be mode 444. These are used to give owner
names as opposed to numbers. There are no passwords stored in pwd.db, they are all in spwd.db, so don't copy that over.</li>
<li><i>/home/ftp/pub</i> - This is a standard directory to place files in which you wish to share. This directory should
also be mode 555.
</ul>

<p> 
Note that all these directories should be owned by ''root''. Here is a listing of what the directories should
look like after their creation.
</p>

<ul>
<pre>
oshibana# pwd 
/home
oshibana# ls -laR ftp

dr-xr-xr-x  5 root  ftp    512 Jul  6 11:33 .

</pre>
</ul>

<h3>Starting up the server and logging</h3>

<p>
With ftpd you can choose to either run it from inetd or the rc scripts can kick it off. These examples will show
our daemon being started from <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/etc/inetd.conf">inetd.conf</a>.
First we must become familiar with some of the options to ftpd. The default line from <i>/etc/inetd.conf</i> is:
</p>

<ul><pre>
<strong>ftp             stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/ftpd       ftpd -US</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
Here ftpd is invoked with <i>-US</i>. This will log anonymous connections to <i>/var/log/ftpd</i> and concurrent
sessions to <i>/var/run/utmp</i>. That will allow for these sessions to be seen via who(1). For some, you might
want to run only an anonymous server, and disallow ftp for users. To do so you should invoke ftpd with the
<i>-A</i> option. Here is a line that starts ftpd up for anonymous connections only. It also uses <i>-ll</i>
which logs each connection to syslog, along with the get, retrieve, etc, ftp commands.
</p>

<ul><pre>
<strong>ftp             stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/libexec/tcpd       ftpd -llUSA</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
Note - For people using HIGH traffic ftp servers, you might want to not invoke ftpd from inetd.conf. The best
option is to comment the ftpd line from inetd.conf and start ftpd from rc.conf along with the <i>-D</i> option.
This will start ftpd as a daemon, and has much less overhead as starting it from inetd. Here is an example line
to start it from rc.conf.
</p>

<ul><pre>
ftpd_flags="-DllUSA"           # for non-inetd use: ftpd_flags="-D"
</pre></ul>

<p>
This of course only works if you have ftpd taken out of <i>/etc/inetd.conf</i>.
</p>

<h3>Other relevant files</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li><i>/etc/ftpwelcome</i> - This holds the Welcome message for people once they have connected to your ftp server.</li>
<li><i>/etc/motd</i> - This holds the message for people once they have successfully logged into your ftp server.</li>  
<li><i>.message</i> - This file can be placed in any directory. It will be shown once a user enters that directory.</li>
</ul>


<p>
<a name= "ftpchroot"></a>
<a name="10.13"></a>
<h2>10.13 - Confining users to their home dir's in ftpd(8).</h2>
</p>

<p>
OpenBSD's <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftpd&sektion=8&format=html">ftpd(8)</a> 
is setup by default to be able to handle this very easily. This is
accomplished via the file <strong>/etc/ftpchroot</strong>. Since users
cannot always be trusted, it might be necessary to restrain them to their
home directories. This behavior is NOT on by default. Here is an example
of what the default behavior is like.
</p>

<ul><pre>

<p>
As you can see here, access is granted to the whole server. In a perfect
world this is ok, where all users can be trusted, but this isn't so. To
limit a user, simply add their name to the file
<strong>/etc/ftpchroot</strong>. Here is an example showing user
&quot;ericj&quot; being restricted.
</p>

<ul><pre>
$ <strong>cat /etc/ftpchroot</strong>
#       $OpenBSD: faq10.html,v 1.64 2002/02/05 23:24:13 nick Exp $
#
# list of users (one per line) given ftp access to a chrooted area.
# read by ftpd(8).
ericj
</pre></ul>

<p>
This is enough to keep the user &quot;ericj&quot; from escaping from his
own directory. As you can see in the next example. The / directory has
suddenly changed to his home dir!

<a name= "Patches"></a>
<a name="10.14"></a>
<h2>10.14 - Applying patches in OpenBSD</h2>
</p>

<p>
The OpenBSD source tree is constantly changing and improving, 
along with this fixes to common problems are often made and patches
released to the public. These patches appear on the errata web page
located at <a href="../errata.html">http://www.openbsd.org/errata.html</a>, 
and are separated into categories. These categories correspond to patches
that should be applied to different architectures or architecture independent
patches.
</p>

<p>
Note, however, that patches aren't made for new additions to OpenBSD, 
and are only done for important reliability fixes or security problems
that should be addressed right away, although the choice to do so is, as
always, up to the administrator.
</p>

<p>
For the examples I will be patching 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=talkd&sektion=8">talkd(8)</a> 
with a security fix from the patch obtained from 
<a href="../errata.html">errata.html</a>.
</p>

<h3>How are these patches different from what I would find in the CVS tree?</h3>

<p>
All patches posted at <a href="../errata.html">http://www.openbsd.org/errata.html</a> are patches
directly against the latest release's source tree. Patches against the
latest CVS tree might also include other changes that wouldn't be wanted
on a release system.
</p>

<h3>Getting your system ready to be patched.</h3>

<p>
Patches for the OpenBSD Operating System are distributed as diffs, which
are text files that hold differences to the original source code. They are
<b>NOT</b> distributed in binary form. This means that to patch your system
you must have the source code from the <b>RELEASE</b> version of OpenBSD
readily available. This does not mean that you must have ALL source code
to the OpenBSD operating system to patch your system, but must have all
code for the program which you are patching. For instance, if you are 
patching the kernel you must have all source for the kernel on hand.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cvs&sektion=1">cvs(1)</a>
is a very handy tool that can be used to grab only the source that you need 
via any of the anonymous cvs servers located around the world. You can get a 
listing of these servers at <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html">http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html</a>.  
</p>

<p>
To retrieve the current release's source code using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cvs&sektion=1">cvs(1)</a>, you would use
the following line: 
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<pre>
$ <b>cvs -danoncvs@anoncvs5.usa.openbsd.org:/cvs co -rOPENBSD_3_0_BASE src/libexec/talkd/</b>
cvs server: Updating src/libexec/talkd
U src/libexec/talkd/announce.c
U src/libexec/talkd/talkd.c
U src/libexec/talkd/talkd.h
</pre>
</div>

<p>
To find the CVS path to the code that you need, you can find this in the patch on the <i>Index:</i> line.
In this case, the CVS path was <i>src/libexec/talkd/</i>. Always check out the revision of OPENBSD_version_number_BASE. Without &quot;_BASE&quot; you will be checking out the stable branch, which might contain other changes that will interfere. If you are already tracking the patch branch, the patches should already be in that source, however you should always check and make sure. You can always look at <a href="../plus.html">http://www.openbsd.org/plus.html</a> to see which patches have been applied to the patch branch. If the patches haven't been applied yet, you will need to grab the latest release source using the commands above.
</p>

<p>
Also, for those users that bought official OpenBSD CDs, you can get the source code directly off of the CD. Refer to the CD insert on how to extract the source from the CD. In which case you won't need to obtain the source via anoncvs.
</p>

<ul><pre>
Apply by doing:
        cd /usr/src
        patch -p0 < 026_talkd.patch
        cd libexec/talkd
        make obj && make depend && make && make install
