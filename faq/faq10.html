<h2 id="DupFS">Duplicating filesystems</h2>

To duplicate everything under directory <tt>/SRC</tt> to directory <tt>/DST</tt>
with <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/dump">dump(8)</a> and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/restore">restore(8)</a>, do:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /SRC && dump 0f - . | (cd /DST && restore -rf - )</b>
</pre></blockquote>

or use <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/tar">tar(1)</a>:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /SRC && tar cf - . | (cd /DST && tar xpf - )</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h2 id="rc">The rc system startup script</h2>

OpenBSD uses the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rc">rc(8)</a> startup system.
Its man page contains a good overview and explains the various scripts and files
involved.
If you wish to enable or disable daemons, use
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rcctl">rcctl(8)</a> to manage your
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rc.conf">rc.conf.local(8)</a> file, as described
below.

<h3>Starting daemons and services that come with OpenBSD</h3>

Most daemons and services that come with OpenBSD are controlled on boot
by variables defined in
<a href="http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/src/etc/rc.conf?content-type=text/plain">/etc/rc.conf</a>.
You'll see lines similar to this:

<blockquote><pre>
httpd_flags=NO
</pre></blockquote>

This shows that <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/httpd">httpd(8)</a> is not to
be started from <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rc">rc(8)</a> at boot time.
Each line has a comment showing you the flags for common usage of that daemon
or service.

<p>
Do not alter <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rc.conf">rc.conf(8)</a> directly.
Instead, use the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rcctl">rcctl(8)</a> utility
to maintain the <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt> file.
This makes future upgrades easier -- all the changes are in the one file that
isn't touched during upgrade.

<p>
For example, to start the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/apmd">apmd(8)</a>
daemon for CPU scaling, you might do:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>rcctl enable apmd</b>
# <b>rcctl set apmd flags -A</b>
# <b>rcctl start apmd</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Starting up local daemons and configuration</h3>

For other daemons which you might install on the system via packages or other
ways, you could use the <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt> file.
For example, say you installed a daemon located at
<tt>/usr/local/sbin/daemonx</tt>.
If you want it to start at boot time, put an entry into <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt>
like this:

<blockquote><pre>
if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/daemonx ]; then
	echo 'Starting daemonx' && /usr/local/sbin/daemonx
fi
</pre></blockquote>

If the daemon does not automatically detach on startup, remember to add "&amp;"
at the end of the command-line.

<p>
From now on, this daemon will be started at boot.
You will be able to see any errors on boot.

<h3>The <tt>/etc/rc.d</tt> directory</h3>

OpenBSD's system daemons ("services") are started, stopped and controlled by
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rc.d">rc.d(8)</a>.
All system daemons are handled by these scripts, and most add-on
<a href="faq15.html">packages</a> are as well.

<p>
These scripts, one per daemon, are invoked by <tt>rc</tt>.
The order for system daemons is coded into <tt>rc</tt>, and the order for
packages is managed by the <tt>pkg_scripts</tt> environment variable, which
would be set in <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt>.
Note that simply placing a script in this directory does not cause it to be run
on boot; the name of the script must be specified in the <tt>pkg_scripts</tt>
variable to start on boot.

<p>
The starting of system scripts is determined by entries in the
<tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt> file.
For example, <tt>/etc/rc.d/httpd</tt> does not start
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/httpd">httpd(8)</a> unless <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt>
or <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt> contains a line defining the <tt>httpd_flags</tt>
variable.

<p>
Note that rather than having each script in rc.d managing the entire startup,
shutdown, reload, restart, and check operations, most rc.d scripts can be
reduced to specifying very few variables, and invoking the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rc.subr">rc.subr(8)</a> script, which manages
most of the standard way of doing these tasks.

<p>
For example, our above <tt>daemonx</tt> application could be started with a
<tt>/etc/rc.d/daemonx</tt> file consisting of:

<blockquote><pre>
#!/bin/sh

daemon="/usr/local/sbin/daemonx"

. /etc/rc.d/rc.subr

rc_cmd $1
</pre></blockquote>

and adding the daemon name to the <tt>pkg_scripts</tt> variable in
<tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt>.

<h2 id="doas">Executing commands as another user</h2>

One challenge system administrators face is the contradictory requirement
of multiple people managing machines using logins that shouldn't be shared.
The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/doas">doas(1)</a> tool can solve this
problem by permitting a certain subset of users to run predetermined commands
as another user.
Regular users can run administrative commands, only needing to authenticate
as themselves, rather than needing the root password.
When using doas, all commands are logged to <tt>/var/log/secure</tt>.

<p>
For example, if appropriately configured, the following command would display
root's <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/crontab.5">crontab(5)</a> file:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>doas crontab -l -u root</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Check the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/doas.conf">doas.conf(5)</a> manual
for configuration examples.

<p>
The doas(1) utility is designed to be a modern, simple replacement for sudo.
If you need features specific to sudo, an up-to-date version is available
as a <a href="faq15.html">package</a>. 

<h2 id="AddDelUser">Managing users and groups</h2>

OpenBSD offers several tools for managing users and groups on your system:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://man.openbsd.org/adduser">adduser(8)</a> and
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rmuser">rmuser(8)</a> run in a
    self-explanatory interactive mode when invoked without any arguments.
  <li>The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/user">user(8)</a> and
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/group.8">group(8)</a> utilities.
</ul>

<h2 id="vipw">Editing the password file</h2>

The main password file is <tt>/etc/master.passwd</tt>, which is only readable
by root.
The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pwd_mkdb">pwd_mkdb(8)</a> utility generates
the publicly readable <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> file and the password databases
<tt>/etc/pwd.db</tt> and <tt>/etc/spwd.db</tt> from <tt>/etc/master.passwd</tt>.
The file format is described in
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/passwd.5">passwd(5)</a>.

<p>
Always use <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/vipw">vipw(8)</a> to edit your
<tt>/etc/master.passwd</tt> file.
vipw(8) will invoke your $EDITOR to edit a copy of <tt>/etc/master.passwd</tt>.
After you are done editing, vipw(8) will first sanity check your changes, then
it will re-create <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> and the password databases, and finally
it will install the copy in place of the original <tt>/etc/master.passwd</tt>
file.
vipw(8) also takes care of locking these files, so that only one user can make
changes at a time.

<h2 id="Quotas">Setting up user disk quotas</h2>

Quotas are used to place limits on the amount of disk space available to certain
users and groups.

<p>
Use the keywords <tt>userquota</tt> and <tt>groupquota</tt> to mark each
filesystem in <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/fstab">fstab(5)</a> on which you
want to enforce quotas.
By default, the files <tt>quota.user</tt> and <tt>quota.group</tt> will be
created at the root of those filesystems.
Here is an example <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> line:

<blockquote><pre>
0123456789abcdef.k /home ffs rw,nodev,nosuid,userquota 1 1
</pre></blockquote>

To set the users' quotas, use
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/edquota">edquota(8)</a>.
For example, issue

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>edquota ericj</b>
</pre></blockquote>

and edit the soft and hard limits:

<blockquote><pre>
Quotas for user ericj:
/home: KBytes in use: 62, limits (soft = <b>1000000</b>, hard = <b>1500000</b>)
        inodes in use: 25, limits (soft = <b>0</b>, hard = <b>0</b>)
</pre></blockquote>

In this example, the soft limit is set to 1000000k, and the hard limit is set to
1500000k.
No limits on the number of inodes will be enforced, since the corresponding soft
and hard limits are set to 0.
Users who exceed their soft limit are warned and are given a grace period to get
their disk usage below their limits.
Grace periods can be set by using the <tt>-t</tt> option on edquota(8).
After the grace period is over, the soft limit is handled as a hard limit.
This usually results in an allocation failure.

<p>
Use <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/quotaon">quotaon(8)</a> to enable quotas:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>quotaon -a</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This will scan through fstab(5) and enable quotas on the filesystems with quota
options.
View quota statistics with <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/quota">quota(1)</a>.

<h2 id="SKey">Using S/Key</h2>

S/Key is a "one-time password" authentication system.
It generates a sequence of one-time (single use) passwords from a user's
secret passphrase along with a challenge received from the server, by means of a
hash function:
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/md5">md5</a>,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sha1">sha1</a> or
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rmd160">rmd160</a>.

<blockquote>
<b>WARNING:</b>
One-time password systems only protect authentication information.
They do not prevent network eavesdroppers from gaining access to private
information.
Furthermore, if you are accessing a secure system A, it is recommended that
you do this from another trusted system B, to ensure nobody is gaining access
to system A by logging your keystrokes or by capturing and/or forging input
and output on your terminal devices.
</blockquote>

<h3>Setting up S/Key</h3>

To start off, the directory <tt>/etc/skey</tt> must exist.
If this directory doesn't exist, have the superuser create it by doing:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>skeyinit -E</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Then use
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/skeyinit">skeyinit(1)</a>
to initialize your S/Key.
You will first be prompted for your login password, then you will be asked for
your S/Key secret passphrase, which must be at least 10 characters long:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>skeyinit</b>
Reminder - Only use this method if you are directly connected
           or have an encrypted channel.  If you are using telnet,
           exit with no password and use skeyinit -s.
Password:
[Adding ericj with md5]
Enter new secret passphrase:
Again secret passphrase:

ID ericj skey is otp-md5 100 oshi45820
Next login password: HAUL BUS JAKE DING HOT HOG
</pre></blockquote>

Notice the information in the last two lines.
The program used to create your S/Key password is
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/otp-md5">otp-md5(1)</a>,
the sequence number is <tt>100</tt> and the secret key is <tt>oshi45820</tt>.
The six small words <tt>HAUL BUS JAKE DING HOT HOG</tt> constitute the S/Key
password with sequence number <tt>100</tt>.

<h3>Generating S/Key passwords</h3>
To generate the S/Key password for the next login, use
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/skeyinfo">skeyinfo(1)</a>
to find out what command to run:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>skeyinfo -v</b>
otp-md5 95 oshi45820
$ <b>otp-md5 95 oshi45820</b>
Reminder - Do not use this program while logged in via telnet.
Enter secret passphrase:
NOOK CHUB HOYT SAC DOLE FUME
</pre></blockquote>

In order to generate a list of S/Key passwords, do:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>otp-md5 -n 5 95 oshi45820</b>
Reminder - Do not use this program while logged in via telnet.
Enter secret passphrase:
91: SHIM SET LEST HANS SMUG BOOT
92: SUE ARTY YAW SEED KURD BAND
93: JOEY SOOT PHI KYLE CURT REEK
94: WIRE BOGY MESS JUDE RUNT ADD
95: NOOK CHUB HOYT SAC DOLE FUME
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Using S/Key to log in</h3>

Here is an example session using S/Key to log in to an ftp server on
<tt>localhost</tt>.
To perform an S/Key login, you append <tt>:skey</tt> to your login name.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>ftp localhost</b>
Connected to localhost.
220 oshibana.shin.ms FTP server (Version 6.5/OpenBSD) ready.
Name (localhost:ericj): <b>ericj:skey</b>
331- otp-md5 93 oshi45820
331 S/Key Password: <b>JOEY SOOT PHI KYLE CURT REEK</b>
[...]
230 User ericj logged in.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp> <b>quit</b>
221 Goodbye.
</pre></blockquote>

Similarly, for
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a> or
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/telnet">telnet(1)</a>:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>ssh -l ericj:skey localhost</b>
otp-md5 91 oshi45821
S/Key Password: <b>SHIM SET LEST HANS SMUG BOOT</b>
Last login: Thu Apr  7 12:21:48 on ttyp1 from 156.63.248.77
$
</pre></blockquote>

<h2 id="Dir">Directory services</h2>

OpenBSD can be used for both servers and clients of databases containing
user credentials, group information and other network-related data.

<h3 id="Dir.available">Which directory services are available?</h3>

Of course, you could use various directory services on OpenBSD.
But YP is the only one that can be accessed directly using standard
C-library functions like
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/getpwent">getpwent(3)</a>,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/getgrent">getgrent(3)</a>,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/gethostbyname">gethostbyname(3)</a>
and so on.
Thus, if you keep your data in a YP database, you do not need to copy it to
local configuration files like
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/master.passwd">master.passwd(5)</a> before you
can use it, for example to authenticate system users.

<p>
YP is a directory service compatible with Sun Microsystems NIS
(Network Information System).
See <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/yp">yp(8)</a> for an overview of the
available manual pages.
Be careful, some operating systems contain directory services bearing similar
names but all the same being incompatible, for example NIS+.

<p>
To use other directory services except YP, you either need to populate local
configuration files from the directory, or you need a YP frontend to
the directory.
For example, you can use the <tt>sysutils/login_ldap</tt> port when you choose
the former, while the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ypldap">ypldap(8)</a>
daemon provides the latter.

<p>
For some applications, simply synchronizing a small number of configuration
files among a group of machines using tools like
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/cron">cron(8)</a>,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/scp">scp(1)</a> or
<tt>rsync</tt> (available from ports) constitutes an easy and robust alternative
to a full-blown directory service.

<h3 id="YP_secure">YP security considerations</h3>

For compatibility reasons, all security features built into the OpenBSD
implementation of YP are switched <i>off</i> by default.
Even when they are all switched on, the NIS protocol is still inherently
insecure for two reasons:
All data, including sensitive data like password hashes, is transmitted
unencrypted across the network, and neither the client nor the server can
reliably verify each other's identity.

<p>
Thus, before setting up any YP server, you should consider whether these
inherent security flaws are acceptable in your context.
In particular, YP is inadequate if potential attackers have physical access
to your network.
Anybody gaining root access to any computer connected to your network segments
carrying YP traffic can bind your YP domain and retrieve its data.
In some cases, passing YP traffic through SSL or IPSec tunnels might be
an option.

<h3 id="YP_server">Setting up a YP server</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    A YP server serves a group of clients called a "domain."
    You should first select a domain name; it can be an arbitrary string and
    need not be related in any way to DNS domain names.
    Choosing a random name like "Eepoo5vi" can marginally improve security,
    though the effect is mostly in security by obscurity.
    In case you need to maintain several distinct YP domains, it's probably
    better to choose descriptive names like "sales," "marketing" and "research"
    in order to forestall system administration errors caused by obscurity.
    Also note that some versions of SunOS require using the host's DNS domain
    name, so your choice might be restricted in a network including such hosts.

    <p>
    Use the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/domainname">domainname(1)</a>
    utility to set the domain name, and put it into the
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/defaultdomain">defaultdomain(5)</a>
    file to have it automatically set at system startup time.

    <blockquote><pre>
    # <b>echo "puffynet" > /etc/defaultdomain</b>
    # <b>domainname `cat /etc/defaultdomain`</b>
    </pre></blockquote>

  <li>
    Initialise the YP server using the interactive command

    <blockquote><pre>
    # <b>ypinit -m</b>
    </pre></blockquote>

    At this point, it is not necessary to specify slave servers yet.
    To add slave servers, you can rerun
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ypinit">ypinit(8)</a>
    later, using the <tt>-u</tt> option.

    Setting up at least one slave server for each domain is useful to avoid
    service interruptions.
    For example, should the master server ever go down or lose network
    connectivity, client processes trying to access YP maps block indefinitely
    until they receive the requested information.
    Thus, YP service interruptions typically render the client hosts completely
    unusable until YP is back to service.

  <li>
    Decide where to store the source files to generate your YP maps from.
    Keeping the server configuration separate from the served configuration
    helps to control which information will be served and which won't, so the
    default <tt>/etc</tt> often isn't the best choice.

    <p>
    The only inconvenience caused by changing the source directory is that you
    will not be able to add, remove and modify users and groups in the
    YP domain using utilities like
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/user">user(8)</a> and
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/group">group(8)</a>.
    Instead, you will have to edit the configuration files with a text editor.

    <p>
    To define the source directory, edit the file
    <tt>/var/yp/`domainname`/Makefile</tt>
    and change the <tt>DIR</tt> variable, e.g.

    <blockquote><pre>
    DIR=/etc/yp/src/puffynet
    </pre></blockquote>

  <li>
    Consider customizing other variables in
    <tt>/var/yp/`domainname`/Makefile</tt>.
    See <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/Makefile.yp">Makefile.yp(8)</a>
    for details.

    <p>
    For example, even in case you use the default source directory
    <tt>/etc</tt>, you do not usually need all accounts and groups existing
    on the server on all your client hosts.
    In particular, not serving the root account and thus keeping root's password
    hash confidential is often beneficial to security.
    Review the values of <tt>MINUID</tt>, <tt>MAXUID</tt>, <tt>MINGID</tt>
    and <tt>MAXGID</tt> and adjust them to you needs.

    <p>
    If all your YP clients run OpenBSD or FreeBSD, exclude the encrypted
    passwords from the <tt>passwd</tt> maps by setting <tt>UNSECURE=""</tt> in
    <tt>/var/yp/`domainname`/Makefile</tt>.

    <p>
    The former practice of editing the template file
    <tt>/var/yp/Makefile.yp</tt> is no longer recommended.
    Changes to that file affect all domains initialized after the change, but
    do not affect domains initialized before the change, so this is error-prone
    either way:
    You both risk that the intended changes do not take effect, and you risk to
    forget about them and have them affect other domains later which they were
    never intended for.

  <li>
    Create the source directory and populate it with the configuration files
    you need.
    See <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/Makefile.yp">Makefile.yp(8)</a>
    to learn which YP maps require which source files.
    For the format of the individual configuration files, refer to
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/passwd.5">passwd(5)</a>,
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/group.5">group(5)</a>,
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/hosts">hosts(5)</a>
    and so on, and look at the examples in <tt>/etc</tt>.

  <li>
    Create the initial version of your YP maps using the commands

    <blockquote><pre>
    # <b>cd /var/yp</b>
    # <b>make</b>
    </pre></blockquote>

    Do not worry about error messages from
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/yppush">yppush(8)</a> right now.
    The YP server is not yet running.

  <li>
    YP uses <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rpc">rpc(3)</a>
    (remote procedure calls) to communicate with clients, so it is necessary
    to enable <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/portmap">portmap(8)</a>.
    To do so, use <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rcctl">rcctl(8)</a>.

    <blockquote><pre>
    # <b>rcctl enable portmap</b>
    # <b>portmap</b>
    </pre></blockquote>

  <li>
    Consider using either the
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/securenet">securenet(5)</a> or the
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ypserv.acl">ypserv.acl(5)</a>
    security feature of the YP server daemon.
    But be aware that both of these only provide IP based access control.
    Thus, they only help as long as potential attackers have neither physical
    access to the hardware of the network segments carrying your YP traffic
    nor root access to any host connected to those network segments.

  <li>
    Finally, start the YP server daemon:

    <blockquote><pre>
    # <b>ypserv</b>
    </pre></blockquote>

    It will automatically be restarted at boot time as long as the directory
    <tt>/var/yp/`domainname`</tt> continues to exist.

  <li>
    To test the new server, consider making it its own client,
    following the instructions in the first part of the next section.
    In case you don't want the server to use its own maps, you can
    disable the client part after the test with the following commands:

    <blockquote><pre>
    # <b>pkill ypbind</b>
    # <b>rm -rf /var/yp/binding</b>
    </pre></blockquote>

  <li>
    If you wish to allow users to change their passwords from client machines,
    then you must enable
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/yppasswdd">yppasswdd(8)</a>:

    <blockquote><pre>
    # <b>rcctl set yppasswdd flags -d /etc/yp/src/puffynet</b>
    # <b>rpc.yppasswdd</b>
    </pre></blockquote>

    If you left the source directory at the default <tt>/etc</tt>,
    just use <tt>rcctl enable yppasswdd</tt>.

  <li>
    Remember that each time you change a file sourced by a YP map,
    you must regenerate your YP maps.

    <blockquote><pre>
    # <b>cd /var/yp</b>
    # <b>make</b>
    </pre></blockquote>

    This updates all database files in <tt>/var/yp/`domainname`</tt>, with
    one exception:  The file <tt>ypservers.db</tt>, listing all YP master
    and slave servers associated with the domain, is created directly
    from <tt>ypinit -m</tt> and modified exclusively by <tt>ypinit -u</tt>.
    In case you accidentally delete it, run <tt>ypinit -u</tt> to recreate
    it from scratch.
</ol>

<h3 id="YP_client">Setting up a YP client</h3>

Setting up a YP client involves two distinct parts.
First, you must get the YP client daemon running,
binding your client host to a YP server.
Completing the following steps will allow you to retrieve data
from the YP server, but that data will not yet be used by the system:

<ol>
  <li>
    Like on the server, you must set the domain name and enable the portmapper:

    <blockquote><pre>
    # <b>echo "puffynet" > /etc/defaultdomain</b>
    # <b>domainname `cat /etc/defaultdomain`</b>
    # <b>rcctl enable portmap</b>
    # <b>portmap</b>
    </pre></blockquote>

  <li>
    It is recommended to provide a list of YP servers in the configuration
    file <tt>/etc/yp/`domainname`</tt>.
    Otherwise, the YP client daemon will use network broadcasts to find
    YP servers for its domain.
    Explicitly specifying the servers is both more robust and marginally
    less open to attack.
    If you have not set up any slave servers, just put the host name
    of the master server into <tt>/etc/yp/`domainname`</tt>.

  <li>
    The YP client daemon is called
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ypbind">ypbind(8)</a>.
    Starting it manually will create the directory <tt>/var/yp/binding</tt>,
    such that it will be automatically restarted at boot time.

    <blockquote><pre>
    # <b>ypbind</b>
    </pre></blockquote>

  <li>
    If all went well you should be able to query the YP server using
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ypcat">ypcat(1)</a>
    and see your passwd map returned.

    <blockquote><pre>
    # <b>ypcat passwd</b>
    bob:*:5001:5000:Bob Nuggets:/home/bob:/usr/local/bin/zsh
    ...
    </pre></blockquote>

    Other useful tools for debugging your YP setup include
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ypmatch">ypmatch(1)</a> and
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/yptest">yptest(8)</a>.
</ol>

The second part of configuring a YP client involves editing local configuration
files such that certain YP maps get used by various system facilities.
Not all servers serve all standard maps supported by the operating system, some
servers serve additional non-standard maps, and you are by no means compelled to
use all those maps.
Which of the available maps shall or shall not be used, and for which purposes
they shall be used, is fully at the discretion of the client host's system
administrator.

<p>
For a list of standard YP maps and their standard usage, see
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/Makefile.yp">Makefile.yp(8)</a>.
The most common use cases include:

<ul>
  <li>
    If you want to include all user accounts from the YP domain, append the
    default YP marker to the master password file and rebuild the password
    database:

    <blockquote><pre>
    # <b>echo '+:*::::::::' >> /etc/master.passwd</b>
    # <b>pwd_mkdb -p /etc/master.passwd</b>
    </pre></blockquote>

    For details on selective inclusion and exclusion of user accounts, see
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/passwd.5">passwd(5)</a>.
    To test whether inclusion actually works, use the
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/id">id(1)</a> utility.

  <li>
    If you want to include all groups from the YP domain, append the default YP
    marker to the group file:

    <blockquote><pre>
    # <b>echo '+:*::' >> /etc/group</b>
    </pre></blockquote>

    For details on selective group inclusion, see
    <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/group">group(5)</a>.
</ul>

<h2 id="Patches">Keeping OpenBSD up to date</h2>

When a critical bug is found, the fix will be committed to the -current tree
as soon as possible.
From that point on, things are handled differently depending on whether the
problem was in the OpenBSD base system or a third party package.
This section details how to keep your system up to date with all the latest
fixes.

<p>
For the OpenBSD base system, there are three options:

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="faq5.html#Snapshots">Upgrade your system to -current</a></b>
    <br>
    As all fixes are applied to the -current code base, updating your system
    to the latest snapshot is a good way to get all the fixes at once.
    However, running -current is not for everyone.
  <li><b><a href="../stable.html">Update your system to -stable</a></b>
    <br>
    This is done by fetching or updating your source tree using the appropriate
    -stable branch, then <a href="faq5.html">recompiling</a> the kernel and
    userland files.
    Overall, this is probably the easiest way, though it takes longer since
    the entire system gets rebuilt.
  <li><b><a href="#Errata">Patch the affected files individually</a></b>
    <br>
    While this typically requires less time than a CVS checkout/update and
    rebuild, there is no one universal set of instructions to follow.
    Sometimes you must patch and recompile one application, sometimes more.
    All patches posted to the <a href="../errata.html">errata web page</a> are
    made directly against the indicated release's source tree.
    This method is explained in more detail <a href="#Errata">below</a>.
</ul>

<p>
For third party software installed via <a href="faq15.html">packages</a>,
there are two options:

<ul>
  <li><b>Upgrade your system to -current and use binary packages</b>
    <br>
    Binary packages for -current snapshots are rebuilt on a regular basis,
    and these new packages will include any security fixes that were committed.
    Simply call <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add">pkg_add(1)</a> with
    the <tt>-u</tt> flag after <a href="faq15.html#Easy">picking a mirror</a>
    to get the new files.
    Remember to use the <tt>/snapshots/</tt> directory!
  <li><b>Update via the -stable ports tree</b>
    <br>
    If you choose to stay on the -release or -stable branch, you will have to
    rebuild affected packages when security issues are found.
    Check out (or update to) the -stable ports branch with
    <a href="../anoncvs.html">CVS</a>, run the
    <tt>/usr/ports/infrastructure/bin/out-of-date</tt> script to list any
    packages that need rebuilding, and finally issue <tt>make update</tt>
    in the affected port directory.
    To be alerted of -stable port updates, consider following the
    "ports-changes" <a href="../mail.html">mailing list</a>.
</ul>

<h3 id="Errata">Applying errata patches</h3>

Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs, which
are text files that hold differences to the original source code.
This means that, to apply a patch, you must have the source code from the
-release version of your system available.

<p>
Whether you download and untar the source trees or fetch them from CVS,
it's best to <a href="faq5.html#wsrc">avoid using root</a> where possible.
Installing the new binaries will be the only step that requires it.

<p>
For our example here, we will look at patch 011 for OpenBSD 5.6, dealing with
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/pppoe">pppoe(4)</a> connections.
Each patch is cryptographically signed with the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/signify">signify(1)</a> tool and contains
instructions on how to apply it properly.
We will assume you have put this patch into your current working directory.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>signify -Vep /etc/signify/openbsd-56-base.pub -x 011_pppoe.patch.sig \</b>
  <b>-m - | (cd /usr/src && patch -p0)</b>

Hmm...  Looks like a unified diff to me...
The text leading up to this was:
--------------------------
|
|OpenBSD 5.6 errata 11, Dec 5, 2014:
|
|An incorrect memcpy call would result in corrupted MAC addresses when
|using PPPOE.
|
|Apply patch using:
|
|    signify -Vep /etc/signify/openbsd-56-base.pub -x 011_pppoe.patch.sig \
|        -m - | (cd /usr/src && patch -p0)
|
|Then build and install a new kernel.
|
|Index: sys/net/if_ethersubr.c

Hunk #1 succeeded at 673.              <i>&lt;-- Look for this message!</i>
done
</pre></blockquote>

Note the "<tt>Hunk #1 succeeded</tt>" message above - this indicates the patch
was applied successfully.
Many patches are more complex than this and will involve multiple hunks and
multiple files, in which case you should verify that all hunks succeeded on
all the files.
Patches are very sensitive to "white space" - copying and pasting from your
browser will often change tab characters into spaces or otherwise alter the
white space of a file, making it not apply.

<p>
At this point, you would <a href="faq5.html#Bld">build and install</a> the
new kernel and reboot the system.

<p>
Not all patches are for the kernel.
In some cases, you will have to rebuild individual utilities.
At other times, will require recompiling all utilities statically linked to a
patched library.
