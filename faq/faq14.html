<h2 id="intro">14.1 - Disks and Partitions</h2>

<p>
The details of setting up disks in OpenBSD vary between platforms, so
you should read the installation instructions in the
<tt>INSTALL.&lt;arch&gt;</tt> file for your 
<a href="../plat.html">platform</a>
to determine the specifics for your system.

<p>
<h3>Drive identification</h3>
OpenBSD handles mass storage with two drivers on most platforms,
depending upon the normal command set that kind of device supports:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=wd&amp;sektion=4">wd(4):</a>
IDE disks (and devices that look like IDE disks, for example, SATA, MFM
or ESDI disks, or a flash device with an appropriate adapter) attached to a
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=wdc&amp;sektion=4">wdc(4)</a>
or
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pciide&amp;sektion=4">pciide(4)</a>
interface.
<li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sd&amp;sektion=4">sd(4):</a>
Devices that utilize SCSI commands, such as SCSI disks attached to a
SCSI adapter, USB disks, SATA disks attached to an
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ahci&amp;sektion=4">ahci(4)</a>
interface, and disk arrays attached to a RAID controller. 
</ul>

The first drive of a particular type identified by OpenBSD will be
drive '0', the second will be '1', etc.
So, the first IDE-like disk will be wd0, the third SCSI-like disk will
be sd2.
If you have two SCSI-like drives and three IDE-like drives on a system,
you would have sd0, sd1, wd0, wd1, and wd2 on that machine.
The order is based on the order they are found during hardware discovery
at boot.
There are a few key points to keep in mind:
<ul>
<li>Drives may not be numbered in the same order as your boot ROM
attempts to boot them (i.e., your system may attempt to boot what OpenBSD
identifies as wd2 or sd1).
Sometimes you may be able to change this, sometimes not.
<li>Removing or adding a disk may impact the identity of other drives on
the system.
</ul>


<h3>Partitioning</h3>

Due to historical reasons, the term "partition" is regularly used for
two different things in OpenBSD and this leads to some confusion.

<p>
The two types of "partitions" are:
<ul>
<li> "disklabel partitions" created with 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&amp;sektion=8">disklabel(8)</a>
(often called "filesystem partitions").
<li> "fdisk partitions" created with 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">fdisk(8)</a>
(often called "partition table partitions" or "Master Boot Record (MBR) partitions").
</ul>

<p>
All OpenBSD platforms use disklabel(8) as the primary way to manage
OpenBSD filesystem partitions, but only some platforms also require 
using fdisk(8) to manage Partition Table partitions.
On the platforms that use fdisk partitions, one fdisk partition is used
to hold all of the OpenBSD file systems, this partition is then sliced
up into disklabel partitions.
These disklabel partitions are labeled "a" through "p".
A few of these are "special":
<ul>
<li><b>a</b> -- On the boot disk, the 'a' partition is your root partition.
<li><b>b</b> -- On the boot disk, the 'b' partition is automatically used
as a swap partition.
<li><b>c</b> -- On all disks, the 'c' partition is the entire disk,
from the first sector to the last.
(Hint: if you wish to totally clear a drive, you write zeros to the
'c' partition of the drive.
More commonly, the 'c' partition is used by utilities like 'fdisk' to
install boot loaders, partition tables, etc.)
</ul>

<h3>Partition identification</h3>
An OpenBSD filesystem is identified by the disk it is on, plus the file
system partition on that disk.
So, file systems may be identified by identifiers like "sd0a" (the "a"
partition of the first "sd" device), "wd2h" (the "h" partition of the
third "wd" device), or "sd1c" (the entire second sd device).
The device files would be <tt>/dev/sd0a</tt> for the block device,
<tt>/dev/rsd0a</tt> would be the device file for the "raw" (character)
device.

<p>
Some utilities will let you use the "shortcut" name of a partition
(i.e., "sd0d") or a drive (i.e., "wd1") instead of the actual device
name ("<tt>/dev/sd0d</tt>" or "<tt>/dev/wd1c</tt>", respectively).


<p>
Note again that if you put data on <tt>wd2d</tt>, then later remove
<tt>wd1</tt> from the system and reboot, your data is now on
<tt>wd1d</tt>, as your old <tt>wd2</tt> is now <tt>wd1</tt>.
However, a drive's identification won't change after boot, so if
a USB drive is unplugged or fails, it won't change the identification
of other drives until reboot.

<h3 id="DUID">Disklabel Unique Identifiers</h3>
Disks can also be identified by Disklabel Unique Identifiers (DUIDs), a
16 hex digit number, managed by the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=diskmap&amp;sektion=4"
>diskmap(4)</a> device.
This number is generated automatically as a random number when a
disklabel is first created, though defaults to all zeros on an existing
(pre OpenBSD 4.8) labels.
disklabel(8) can be used to change the UID if desired.
These UIDs are "persistent" -- if you identify your disks this way,
drive "<tt>f18e359c8fa2522b</tt>" will always be
<tt>f18e359c8fa2522b</tt>, no matter what order or how it is attached.
You can specify partitions on the disk by appending a period and the
partition letter, for example, <tt>f18e359c8fa2522b.d</tt> is the 'd'
partition of the disk <tt>f18e359c8fa2522b</tt> and will ALWAYS refer
to the same chunk of storage, no matter what order the device is attached
to the system, or what kind of interface it is attached to.

<p>
These UIDs can be used to identify the disks almost anywhere a partition
or device would be specified, for example in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> or in
command lines.
Of course, disks and partitions may also be identified in the
traditional way, by device, unit number and partition (i.e., /dev/sd1f),
and this can be done interchangeably.

<p>
It is worth noting that the DUID is a property of the disklabel, though
as OpenBSD only supports one disklabel per disk, this is mostly academic.


<h2 id="fdisk">14.2 - Using fdisk(8)</h2>

Be sure to check the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">fdisk(8)</a>
man page.

<p>
fdisk(8) is used on some platforms (i386, amd64, macppc, zaurus and
armish) to create a partition recognized by the system boot ROM, into
which the OpenBSD disklabel partitions can be placed.
Other platforms do not need or use fdisk(8).
fdisk(8) can also be used for manipulations of the Master Boot Record (MBR),
which can impact all operating systems on a computer.
Unlike the fdisk-like programs on some other operating systems,
OpenBSD's fdisk assumes you know what you want to do, and for the most
part, it will let you do what you need to do, making it a powerful tool
to have on hand.
It will also let you do things you shouldn't or didn't intend to do, so
it must be used with care.

<p>
Normally, only one OpenBSD fdisk partition will be placed on a disk.
That partition will be subdivided by <a href="#disklabel">disklabel</a>
into OpenBSD filesystem partitions.

<p>

<p>
To just view your partition table using fdisk, use:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk sd0</b><br>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Which will give an output similar to this:

<blockquote><pre>
Disk: sd0       geometry: 553/255/63 [8883945 Sectors]
Offset: 0       Signature: 0xAA55
         Starting       Ending       LBA Info:
 #: id    C   H  S -    C   H  S [       start:      size   ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*0: A6    3   0  1 -  552 254 63 [       48195:     8835750 ] OpenBSD     
 1: 12    0   1  1 -    2 254 63 [          63:       48132 ] Compaq Diag.
 2: 00    0   0  0 -    0   0  0 [           0:           0 ] unused      
 3: 00    0   0  0 -    0   0  0 [           0:           0 ] unused      
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In this example we are viewing the fdisk output of the first SCSI-like
drive.
We can
see the OpenBSD partition (id A6) and its size. The * tells us that the
OpenBSD partition is the bootable partition.

<p>
In the previous example we just viewed our information. What if we want
to edit our partition table? Well, to do so we must use the <b>-e</b>
flag.  This will bring up a command line prompt to interact with fdisk.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -e wd0</b>
Enter 'help' for information
fdisk: 1&gt; <b>help</b>
        help            Command help list
        manual          Show entire OpenBSD man page for fdisk
        reinit          Re-initialize loaded MBR (to defaults)
        setpid          Set the identifier of a given table entry
        disk            Edit current drive stats
        edit            Edit given table entry
        flag            Flag given table entry as bootable
        update          Update machine code in loaded MBR
        select          Select extended partition table entry MBR
        swap            Swap two partition entries
        print           Print loaded MBR partition table
        write           Write loaded MBR to disk
        exit            Exit edit of current MBR, without saving changes
        quit            Quit edit of current MBR, saving current changes
        abort           Abort program without saving current changes
fdisk: 1&gt; 
</pre></blockquote>

<p> 

<p>Here is an overview of the commands you can use when you choose the
<b>-e</b> flag.

<ul>
<li><b>help</b>  Display a list of commands that fdisk understands in
the interactive edit mode.
<li><b>reinit</b>  Initialize the currently selected, in-memory copy of
the boot block.
This is a handy way to quickly slap a "full-disk" OpenBSD partition in
place, update the boot code, and in general, make the system ready for
OpenBSD (and nothing but OpenBSD).
<li><b>disk</b>  Display the current drive geometry that fdisk is using.
You are given a chance to edit it if you wish.
<li><b>setpid</b>  Change the partition identifier of the given
partition table entry. This command is particularly useful for
reassigning an existing partition to OpenBSD.
<li><b>edit</b>  Edit a given table entry in the memory copy of the
current boot block.  You may edit either in CHS geometry mode, or in
sector offsets and sizes.
<li><b>flag</b>  Make the given partition table entry bootable. Only one
entry can be marked bootable. If you wish to boot from an extended
partition, you will need to mark the partition table entry for the
extended partition as bootable.
<li><b>update</b>  Update the machine code in the memory copy of the
currently selected boot block.
<li><b>select</b>  Select and load into memory the boot block pointed to
by the extended partition table entry in the current boot block.
<li><b>swap</b> Swaps two MBR entries, so you can re-order the MBR.
<li><b>print</b>   Print the currently selected in-memory copy of the
boot block and its MBR table to the terminal.
<li><b>write</b>   Write the in-memory copy of the boot block
to disk. You will be asked to confirm this operation.
<li><b>exit</b>  Exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to
the previously selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the
program if there is none.
<li><b>quit</b>  Exit the current level of fdisk, either returning to
the previously selected in-memory copy of a boot block, or exiting the
program if there is none.  Unlike exit it does write the modified block
out.
<li><b>abort</b>   Quit program without saving current changes.
</ul>

<h3>fdisk tricks and tips</h3>
<ul>
<!-- <li>On OpenBSD platforms which use fdisk, you should leave the first
track free.
This leaves room for the Master Boot Record, which is where the fdisk
partition table resides.  (not sure if this is true) -->
<li>fdisk(8) offers the ability to specify partitions both in raw sectors
and in Cylinder/Head/Sector formats.
Both options are given for a reason -- some tasks are easier
accomplished one way, others the other way.
Don't lock yourself into only using one option.
<li>A totally blank disk will need to have the master boot record's boot
code written to the disk before it can boot.
You can use the "reinit" or "update" options to do this.
If you fail to do this, you can write a valid partition table with
fdisk, but not have a bootable disk.
You may wish to update the existing boot code anyway if you are
uncertain of its origin.
<li>If your system has a "maintenance" or "diagnostic" partition, it is
recommended that you leave it in place or install it BEFORE installing
OpenBSD.
<li> For historical reasons, "q" saves changes and exits the program,
and "x" exits without saving.
This is the opposite of what many people are now used to in other
environments.
fdisk(8) does not warn before saving the changes, so use with care.

</ul>


<h2 id="disklabel">14.3 - Using OpenBSD's disklabel(8)</h2>
<h3 id="disklabel.1">What is disklabel(8)?</h3>
  
<p>
First, be sure to read the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&amp;sektion=8">disklabel(8)</a>
man page.

<p>
The details of setting up disks in OpenBSD varies somewhat between
platforms.
For <a href="../i386.html">i386</a>,
<a href="../amd64.html">amd64</a>,
<a href="../macppc.html">macppc</a>,
<a href="../zaurus.html">zaurus</a>,
and <a href="../armish.html">armish</a>,
disk setup is done in two stages.
First, the OpenBSD slice of the hard disk is defined using fdisk(8),
then that slice is subdivided into OpenBSD partitions using
disklabel(8).

<p>
All OpenBSD platforms, however, use disklabel(8) as the primary way to
manage OpenBSD partitions.
Platforms that also use fdisk(8) place all the disklabel(8) partitions
in a single fdisk partition.

<p>
Labels hold certain information about your disk, like your drive
geometry and information about the filesystems on the disk.
The disklabel is then used by the bootstrap program to
access the drive and to know where filesystems are contained on the
drive.
You can read more in-depth information about disklabel in the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&amp;sektion=5">disklabel(5)</a>
man page.

<p>
On some platforms, disklabel helps overcome architecture limitations on
disk partitioning.
For example, on i386, you can
have 4 primary partitions, but with 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&amp;sektion=8">disklabel(8),</a>
you use one of these 'primary' partitions to store all of your 
OpenBSD partitions (for example, 'swap', '/', '/usr', '/var', etc.), 
and you still have 3 more partitions available for other OSs.

<h3 id="disklabel.2">disklabel(8) during OpenBSD's install</h3>

<p>
One of the major parts of OpenBSD's install is your initial creation of
labels.
During the install you use disklabel(8) to create your separate
partitions.
As part of the install process, you can define your mount points from
within disklabel(8), but you can change these later in the install or
post-install, as well.

<p>
There is not one "right" way to label a disk, but there are many wrong
ways.
Before attempting to label your disk, see
<a href="faq4.html#Partitioning">this discussion</a> on partitioning and
partition sizing.

<p>
For an example of using disklabel(8) during install, see the
<a href="faq4.html#Moredisklabel">Custom disklabel layout</a> part of the
<a href="faq4.html">Installation Guide</a>.


<h3 id="disklabel.3">Using disklabel(8) after install</h3>

<p>
After install, one of the most common reasons to use disklabel(8) is to
look at how your disk is laid out.
The following command will show you the current disklabel, without 
modifying it:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>disklabel wd0</b> &lt;-- <i>Or whatever disk device you'd like to view</i>

  d:          4195296          5219424  4.2BSD   2048 16384    1 # /usr
  e:          4195296          9414720  4.2BSD   2048 16384    1 # /tmp
  f:         20972448         13610016  4.2BSD   2048 16384    1 # /var

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note how this disk has only part of its disk space allocated at this
time.

Disklabel offers two different modes for editing the disklabel, a
built-in command-driven editor (this is how you installed OpenBSD
originally), and a full editor, such as 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vi&amp;sektion=1">vi(1)</a>.
You may find the command-driven editor "easier", as it guides you through all
the steps and provides help upon request, but the full-screen editor has
definite use, too.

<p>
Let's add a partition to the above system.

<p>
<blockquote>
<i>Warning: Any time you are fiddling with your disklabel, you are
putting all the data on your disk at risk.
Make sure your data is backed up before editing an existing
disklabel!</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
We will use the built-in command-driven editor, which is invoked using
the "-E" option to disklabel(8).

Write new label?: [y] 
</pre></blockquote>

In this case, disklabel(8) was kind enough to calculate a good starting
offset for the partition.
In many cases, it will be able to do this, but if you have "holes" in
the disklabel (i.e., you deleted a partition, or you just like making 
your life miserable) you may need to sit down with a paper and pencil
to calculate the proper offset.
Note that while disklabel(8) does some sanity checking, it is very 
possible to do things very wrong here.
Be careful, understand the meaning of the numbers you are entering.

<p>
On most OpenBSD platforms, there are sixteen disklabel partitions
available, labeled "a" through "p".
(some "specialty" systems may have only eight).
Every disklabel should have a 'c' partition, with an "fstype" of
"unused" that covers the entire physical drive.
If your disklabel is not like this, it must be fixed, the "D" option
(below) can help.
Never try to use the "c" partition for anything other than accessing the
raw sectors of the disk, do not attempt to create a file system on "c".
On the boot device, "a" is reserved for the root partition, and "b" is 
the swap partition, but only the boot device makes these distinctions.
Other devices may use all fifteen partitions other than "c" for file 
systems.

<p>
<h3>Disklabel tricks and tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Get help:</b>  In the command-driven mode, hitting "?" will produce a 
list of available commands.
"M" will show the man page for disklabel(8).

<li><b>Reset to default:</b> In some cases, you may wish to completely
restart from scratch and delete all existing disklabel information.
The "D" command will reset the label back to default, as if there had
never been a disklabel on the drive.

<li><b>Duplicating a disklabel:</b> In some cases, you may wish to 
duplicate the partitioning from one disk to another, but not precisely
(for example, you wish to have the same partitions, but on different 
sizes of drives).
Use the '-e' (full-screen editor) mode of disklabel(8) to capture the 
partitions of the "model" drive, paste it into the new drive, remove the 
model's 'c' partition, save, and you have copied the disk layout to the
other drive without altering its basic parameters.

<li>(sparc/sparc64) <b>Don't put swap at the very beginning of your
disk.</b>
While Solaris often puts swap at the very beginning of a disk, OpenBSD
requires the boot partition to be at the beginning of the disk.

<li>(fdisk platforms) <b>Leave first track free:</b>
On platforms using fdisk(8), you should leave the first logical track
unused, both in disklabel(8) and in fdisk(8).
On "modern" computers (i.e., almost everything that will run OpenBSD),
the exact amount doesn't really matter, though for performance reasons
on the newest disks, having partitions aligned at 4k boundaries is good
for performance.
For this reason, OpenBSD now defaults to starting the first partition at
block 64 instead of 63.

<li><b>Devices without a disklabel:</b>
If a device does not currently have an OpenBSD disklabel on it but has 
another file system (for example, a disk with a pre-existing FAT32 file
system), the OpenBSD kernel will "create" one in memory, and that can form
the basis of a formal OpenBSD disklabel to be stored on disk.
However, if a disklabel is created and saved to disk, and a non-OpenBSD
file system is added later, the disklabel will not be automatically
updated.
You must do this yourself if you wish OpenBSD to be able to access this
file system.
More on this <a href="faq14.html#foreignfsafter">below</a>.

<li><b>"q" vs. "x":</b>
For historical reasons, while in the command-driven editor mode, "q"
saves changes and exits the program, and "x" exits without saving.
This is the opposite of what many people are now used to in other
environments.
disklabel(8) does warn before saving the changes, though it will
"x" quickly and quietly.

<li><b>Auto-partitioning:</b>
New users are encouraged to use the 'A' command to auto-create a
recommended disklabel.
You can then edit or alter the auto-created label as you need.


</ul>


<h2 id="NewDisk">14.4 - Adding extra disks in OpenBSD</h2>
<!-- XXX whoa. this section needs rework -->
<p>
Well once you get your disk installed <b>PROPERLY</b> you need to use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">fdisk(8)</a>
(<i>i386 only</i>) and 
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&amp;sektion=8">disklabel(8)</a>
to set up your disk in OpenBSD.

<p>
For i386 folks, start with fdisk.  Other architectures can ignore this.
In the below example we're adding a third SCSI-like drive to the system. 

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -i sd2</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This will initialize the disk's "real" partition table for exclusive use
by OpenBSD.
Next you need to create a disklabel for it.  This will seem confusing.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>disklabel -e sd2</b>

<i>(screen goes blank, your $EDITOR comes up)</i>
type: SCSI
<i>...bla...</i>
sectors/track: 63
total sectors: 6185088
<i>...bla...</i>
16 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
  c:  6185088        0    unused        0     0         # (Cyl.    0 - 6135)
  d:  1405080       63    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.    0*- 1393*)
  e:  4779945  1405143    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl. 1393*- 6135)
</pre></blockquote>

First, ignore the 'c' partition, it's always there and is for programs
like disklabel to function! 
Fstype for OpenBSD is 4.2BSD.
Total sectors is the total size of the disk.  Say
this is a 3 gigabyte disk.  Three gigabytes in disk manufacturer terms
is 3000 megabytes.  So divide 6185088/3000 (use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=bc&amp;sektion=1">bc(1)</a>).
You get 2061.  So, to make up partition sizes for a, d, e, f, g, ...
just multiply X*2061 to get X megabytes of space on that partition.
The offset for your first new partition should be the same as the
"sectors/track" reported earlier in disklabel's output.  For us it is
63.  The offset for each partition afterwards should be a combination of
the size of each partition and the offset of each partition (except the
'c' partition, since it has no play into this equation.)

<p>
Or, if you just want one partition on the disk, say you will use the
whole thing for web storage or a home directory or something, just take
the total size of the disk and subtract the sectors per track from it.
6185088-63 = 6185025.  Your partition is

<blockquote><pre>
    d:  6185025       63    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16 
</pre></blockquote>

<b>If all this seems needlessly complex, you can just use disklabel -E
to get the same partitioning mode that you got on your install disk!</b>
There, you can just use "96M" to specify "96 megabytes", or 96G for 96
gigs.

<p>
That was a lot.  But you are not finished.  Finally, you need to create
the filesystem on that disk using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=newfs&amp;sektion=8">newfs(8)</a>.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>newfs sd2d </b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Or whatever your disk was named as per OpenBSD's disk numbering scheme.
(Look at the output from
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8">dmesg(8)</a>
to see what your disk was named by OpenBSD.)

<p>
Now figure out where you are going to mount this new partition you just created.
Say you want to put it on /u.  First, make the directory /u.  Then, mount it.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mount /dev/sd2d /u</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Finally, add it to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fstab&amp;sektion=5">/etc/fstab(5)</a>.

<blockquote><pre>
/dev/sd2d /u ffs rw 1 1
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
What if you need to migrate an existing directory like /usr/local? You
should mount the new drive in /mnt and copy /usr/local to the /mnt directory.
Example:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/local && pax -rw -p e . /mnt</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Edit the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fstab&amp;sektion=5">/etc/fstab(5)</a>
file to show that the /usr/local partition is now /dev/sd2d (your
freshly formatted partition). Example:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>/dev/sd2d /usr/local ffs rw 1 1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Reboot into single user mode with <b>boot -s</b>, move the existing
/usr/local to /usr/local-backup (or delete it if you feel lucky) and
create an empty directory /usr/local. Then reboot the system, and voila,
the files are there!

<h2 id="Swap">14.5 - How is swap handled?</h2>

<h3 id="SwapAbout">14.5.1 - About swap</h3>
Historically, all kinds of rules have been tossed about to guide
administrators on how much swap to configure on their machines.
The problem, of course, is there are few "normal" applications.

<p>
One non-obvious use for swap is to be a place the kernel can dump a copy
of what is in core in the event of a system panic for later analysis.
For this to work, you must have a swap partition (not a swap file) at
least as large as your RAM.
By default, the system will save a copy of this dump to
<tt>/var/crash</tt> on reboot, so if you wish to be able to do this
automatically, you will need sufficient <i>free</i> space on
<tt>/var</tt>.
However, you can also bring the system up single-user, and use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=savecore&amp;sektion=8">savecore(8)</a>
to dump it elsewhere.

<p>
Many types of systems may be appropriately configured with no swap
at all.
For example, firewalls should not swap in normal operation.
Machines with flash storage generally should not swap.
If your firewall is flash based, you may benefit (slightly) by
not allocating a swap partition, though in most other cases,
a swap partition won't actually hurt anything; most disks have
more than enough space to allocate a little to swap.

<p>
There are all kinds of tips about optimizing swap (where on the disk,
separate disks, etc.), but if you find yourself in a situation where
optimizing swap is an issue, you probably need more RAM.
In general, the best optimization for swap is to not need it.

<p>
In OpenBSD, swap is managed with the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=swapctl&amp;sektion=8">swapctl(8)</a>
program, which adds, removes, lists and prioritizes swap devices and
files.

<h3 id="SwapPartition">14.5.2 - Swapping to a partition</h3>
<p>
On OpenBSD, the 'b' partition of the boot drive is used by default and
automatically for swap.
No configuration is needed for this to take place.
If you do not wish to use swap on the boot disk, do not define a
"b" partition.
If you wish to use swap on other partitions or on other disks, you
need to define these partitions in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> with lines
something like:

<blockquote><pre>
/dev/sd3b none swap sw 0 0
/dev/sd3d none swap sw 0 0
</pre></blockquote>

<h3 id="SwapFile">14.5.3 - Swapping to a file</h3>

(Note: if you are looking to swap to a file because you are getting
&quot;virtual memory exhausted&quot; errors, you should try raising
the per-process limits first with 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=csh&amp;sektion=1">csh(1)</a>'s unlimit,
or
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sh&amp;sektion=1">sh(1)</a>'s ulimit.)

<p>
Sometimes, your initial guess about how much swap you need proves to
be wrong, and you have to add additional swap space, occasionally in
a hurry (as in, "Geez, at the rate it is burning swap, we'll be wedged
in five minutes").
If you find yourself in this position, adding swap space as a file on
an existing file system can be a quick fix.

<p>
The file must not reside on a filesystem which has SoftUpdates
enabled (they are disabled by default).  To start out, you can see how
much swap you currently have and how much you are using with the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=swapctl&amp;sektion=8">swapctl(8)</a>
utility. You can do this by using the command:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>swapctl -l</b>
Device      512-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Priority
swap_device      65520        8    65512     0%    0
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This shows the devices currently being used for swapping and their
current statistics. In the above example there is only one device named
&quot;swap_device&quot;. This is the predefined area on disk that is
used for swapping. (Shows up as partition b when viewing disklabels) As
you can also see in the above example, that device isn't getting much
use at the moment, but for the purposes of this document, we will act as
if an extra 32M is needed.

<p>
The first step to setting up a file as a swap device is to create the
file. It's best to do this with the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&amp;sektion=1">dd(1)</a>
utility. Here is an example of creating the file <i>/var/swap</i> that
is 32M in size.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swap bs=1k count=32768</b>
32768+0 records in
32768+0 records out
33554432 bytes transferred in 20 secs (1677721 bytes/sec)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Once this has been done, we can turn on swapping to that device. Use the
following command to turn on swapping to this device

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>sudo chmod 600 /var/swap</b>
$ <b>sudo swapctl -a /var/swap</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now we need to check to see if it has been correctly added to the list
of our swap devices.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>swapctl -l</b>
Device      512-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Priority
swap_device      65520        8    65512     0%    0
/var/swap        65536        0    65536     0%    0
Total           131056        8   131048     0%
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now that the file is setup and swapping is being done, you need to add a
line to your <i>/etc/fstab</i> file so that this file is configured on
the next boot time also. If this line is not added, your won't have this
swap device configured.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cat /etc/fstab</b>
/dev/wd0a / ffs rw 1 1
/var/swap /var/swap swap sw 0 0
</pre></blockquote>


<h2 id="SoftUpdates">14.6 - Soft Updates</h2>

<p>
Soft Updates is based on an idea proposed by
<a href="http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/papers/CSE-TR-254-95/">Greg Ganger
and Yale Patt</a> and developed for FreeBSD by
<a href="http://www.mckusick.com/softdep/">Kirk McKusick</a>.
SoftUpdates imposes a partial ordering on the buffer cache
operations which permits the requirement for synchronous writing of
directory entries to be removed from the FFS code. Thus, a large
performance increase is seen in disk writing performance.

<p>
Enabling soft updates must be done with a mount-time option. When
mounting a partition with the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mount&amp;sektion=8">mount(8)</a> 
utility, you can specify that you wish to have soft updates enabled on
that partition. Below is a sample
<i><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fstab&amp;sektion=5">/etc/fstab(5)</a></i> 
entry that has one partition <i>sd0a</i> that we wish to have mounted
with soft updates.

<blockquote><pre>
/dev/sd0a / ffs rw,softdep 1 1
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note to sparc users: Do not enable soft updates on sun4 or sun4c
machines.  These architectures support only a very limited amount of
kernel memory and cannot use this feature.  However, sun4m machines are
fine.

<p>
<a name="BootAmd64"></a>
<h2 id="Boot386">14.7 - How do OpenBSD/i386 and OpenBSD/amd64 boot?</h2>
The boot process for OpenBSD/i386 and OpenBSD/amd64 is not trivial, and
understanding how it works can be useful to troubleshoot a problem when
things don't work.
There are four key pieces to the boot process:
<ol>
<li><b><i>Master Boot Record (MBR):</i></b> The Master Boot Record is
the first 512 bytes on the disk.
It contains the primary partition table and a small program to load
the Partition Boot Record (PBR).
Note that in some environments, the term "MBR" is used to refer to only
the code portion of this first block on the disk, rather than the whole
first block (including the partition table).
It is critical to understand the meaning of "initialize the MBR" -- in
the terminology of OpenBSD, it would involve rewriting the entire MBR,
clearing any existing partition table, not just the code, as it
might on some systems.
You will often not want to do this.
Instead, use fdisk(8)'s "-u" command line option
("<tt>fdisk -u wd0</tt>") to (re)install the MBR boot code.

<p>
While OpenBSD includes its own MBR code, you are not obliged
to use it, as virtually any MBR code can boot OpenBSD.  
The MBR is manipulated by the fdisk(8) program, which is used both to 
edit the partition table, and also to install the MBR code on the 
disk.

<p>
OpenBSD's MBR announces itself with the message:

<blockquote><pre>
Using drive 0, partition 3.
</pre></blockquote>

showing the disk and partition it is about to load the PBR from.
In addition to the obvious, it also shows a trailing period ("."), which
indicates this machine is capable of using LBA translation to boot.
If the machine were incapable of using LBA translation, the above
period would have been replaced with a semicolon (";"), indicating
CHS translation:

<blockquote><pre>
Using drive 0, partition 3;
</pre></blockquote>

Note that the trailing period or semicolon can be used as an indicator
of the "new" OpenBSD MBR, introduced with OpenBSD 3.5.

<p>
<li><b><i>Partition Boot Record (PBR):</i></b>
The Partition Boot Record, also called the PBR or 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=biosboot&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">biosboot(8)</a>
(after the name of the file that holds the code) is the first 512 bytes
of the OpenBSD partition of the disk.
The PBR is the "first-stage boot loader" for OpenBSD.
It is loaded by the MBR code,
and has the task of loading the OpenBSD second-stage boot loader,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">boot(8)</a>.
Like the MBR, the PBR is a very tiny section of code and data,
only 512 bytes, total.
That's not enough to have a fully filesystem-aware application, so
rather than having the PBR locate <tt>/boot</tt> on the disk, the 
BIOS-accessible location of <tt>/boot</tt> is physically coded into the
PBR at installation time.

<p>
The PBR is installed by
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=installboot&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">installboot(8)</a>,
which is further described <a href="faq14.html#InstBoot">later in this
document</a>.
The PBR announces itself with the message:
<blockquote><pre>
Loading...
</pre></blockquote>
printing a dot for every file system block it attempts to load.
Again, the PBR shows if it is using LBA or CHS to load, if it has 
to use CHS translation, it displays a message with a semicolon:
<blockquote><pre>
Loading;...
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<li><b><i>Second Stage Boot Loader, <tt>/boot</tt>:</i></b> <tt>/boot</tt> is
loaded by the PBR, and has the task of accessing the OpenBSD file system
through the machine's BIOS, and locating and loading the actual kernel.  
boot(8) also passes various options and information to the kernel.
<p>
boot(8) is an interactive program.  After it loads, it attempts to locate 
and read <tt>/etc/boot.conf</tt>, if it exists (which it does not on a 
default install), and processes any commands in it.  Unless instructed
otherwise by <tt>/etc/boot.conf</tt>, it then gives the user a prompt:

<blockquote><pre>
probing: pc0 com0 com1 apm mem[636k 190M a20=on]
disk: fd0 hd0+
>> OpenBSD/i386 BOOT 3.26
boot>
</pre></blockquote>

It gives the user (by default) five seconds to start giving it other
tasks, but if none are given before the timeout, it starts its default
behavior: loading the kernel, <tt>bsd</tt>, from the root partition of
the first hard drive.
The second-stage boot loader probes (examines) your system hardware,
through the BIOS (as the OpenBSD kernel is not loaded).
Above, you can see a few things it looked for and found:
<ul>
<li><b>pc0</b> - the standard keyboard and video display of an i386
system.
<li><b>com0, com1</b> - Two serial ports
<li><b>apm</b> - Advanced Power Management BIOS functions
<li><b>636k 190M</b> - The amount of conventional (below 1M) and
extended (above 1M) memory it found
<li><b>fd0 hd0+</b> - The BIOS disk devices found, in this case, one floppy and one hard
disk.
</ul>

The '+' character after the "hd0" indicates that the BIOS has told
<tt>/boot</tt> that this disk can be accessed via LBA.
When doing a first-time install, you will sometimes see a '*' after a
hard disk -- this indicates a disk that does not seem to have a valid
OpenBSD disk label on it. 

<p>
<li><b><i>Kernel: <tt>/bsd</tt></i>:</b>  This is the goal of the boot process,
to have the OpenBSD kernel loaded into RAM and properly running.
Once the kernel has loaded, OpenBSD accesses the hardware directly,
no longer through the BIOS.

</ol>

So, the very start of the boot process could look like this:

<blockquote><pre>
Using drive 0, partition 3.                      <b><i>&lt;- MBR</i></b>
Loading....                                      <b><i>&lt;- PBR</i></b>

<h3>What can go wrong</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Bad/invalid/incompatible MBR:</b>
Usually, a used hard disk has some MBR code in place, but if the
disk is new or moved from a different platform, AND you don't answer "w"
to the "Use (W)hole disk or (E)dit the MBR?" question of the
<a href="faq4.html#InstDisks">installation process</a>, you may end up
with a disk without a valid MBR, and thus, it will not be bootable, even
though it has a valid partition table.

<p>
You may install the OpenBSD MBR on your hard disk using the fdisk
program.  Boot from your install media, choose "Shell" to get a command
prompt:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -u wd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

You may also install a specific MBR to disk using fdisk:
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -u -f /usr/mdec/mbr wd0 </b>
</pre></blockquote>

which will install the file <tt>/usr/mdec/mbr</tt> as your system's
MBR.
This particular file on a standard OpenBSD install happens
to be the standard MBR that is also built into fdisk, but any other
MBR could be specified here.

<li><b>Invalid <tt>/boot</tt> location installed in PBR:</b>
When installboot(8) installs the partition boot record, it writes the
block number and offset of <tt>/boot</tt>'s inode into the PBR.
Therefore, deleting and replacing <tt>/boot</tt> without re-running
<a href="faq14.html#InstBoot">installboot(8)</a> will render
your system unbootable, as the PBR will load whatever happens to be 
pointed to by the inode specified in it, which will almost certainly no
longer be the desired second-stage boot loader!

Since <tt>/boot</tt> is being read using BIOS calls, old versions of 
the PBR were sensitive to BIOS disk translation.
If you altered the
drive's geometry (i.e., took it out of one computer that uses CHS
translation and moving it into one that uses LBA translation, or even
changed a translation option in your BIOS), it would have <i>appeared to the BIOS</i>
to be in a different location (a different numerical block must be accessed
to get the same data from the disk), so you would have had to run
installboot(8) before the system could be rebooted.
The new (as of OpenBSD 3.5 and later) PBR is much more tolerant to 
changes in translation.
</ul>

As the PBR is very small, its range of error messages is pretty limited,
and somewhat cryptic.  Most likely messages are:

<ul>
<li><b>ERR R</b> -- BIOS returned an error when trying to read a
block from the disk.
Usually means exactly what it says: your disk wasn't readable.
<li><b>ERR M</b> -- An invalid 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=magic&amp;sektion=5">magic(5)</a>
number was read in the second-stage bootloader's header.
This generally means whatever it was that was read in was NOT
<tt>/boot</tt>, usually meaning installboot(8) was run incorrectly,
the /boot file was altered, or you have exceeded your BIOS's ability
to read a <a href="#LargeDrive">large disk</a>.

</ul>
Other error messages are detailed in the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=biosboot&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">biosboot(8)</a>
manual page.

<h2 id="LargeDrive">14.8 - What are the issues regarding large drives with OpenBSD?</h2>

<p>
OpenBSD supports both FFS and FFS2 (also known as UFS and
UFS2) file systems.
FFS is the historic OpenBSD file system, FFS2 is new as of 4.3.
Before looking at the limits of each system, we need to look at some
more general system limits.

<p>
Of course, the ability of file system and the abilities of particular
hardware are two different things.
A newer 250G IDE hard disk may have issues on older (pre >137G
standards) interfaces (though for the most part, they work just fine),
and some very old SCSI adapters have been seen to
have problems with more modern drives, and some older BIOSs will hang
when they encounter a modern sized hard disk.
You must respect the abilities of your hardware and boot code, of
course.

<h3>Partition size and location limitations</h3>
Unfortunately, the full ability of the OS isn't available until AFTER
the OS has been loaded into memory.
The boot process has to utilize (and is thus limited
by) the system's boot ROM.
 
<p>
For this reason, the entire /bsd file (the kernel) must be located on
the disk within the boot ROM addressable area.
This means that on some older i386 systems, the root partition must be
completely within the first 504M, but newer computers may have limits of
2G, 8G, 32G, 128G or more.
It is worth noting that many relatively new computers which support 
larger than 128G drives actually have BIOS limitations of booting 
only from within the first 128G.
You can use these systems with large drives, but your root partition
must be within the space supported by the boot ROM.
 
<p>
Note that it is possible to install a 40G drive on an old 486 and load
OpenBSD on it as one huge partition, and think you have successfully
violated the above rule.  However, it might come back to haunt you in a
most unpleasant way:

<ul>
  <li>You install on the 40G / partition.  It works, because the base 
OS and all its files (including /bsd) are within the first 504M.
  <li>You use the system, and end up with more than 504M of files on it.
  <li>You upgrade, and copy your new /bsd over the old one. 
  <li>You reboot.
  <li>You get a message such as "ERR M" or other problems on boot.
</ul>
<p>
Why?  Because when you copied "over" the new /bsd file, it didn't 
overwrite the old one, it got relocated to a new location on the 
disk, probably outside the 504M range the BIOS supported.  The 
boot loader was unable to fetch the file /bsd, and the 
system hung.

<p>
To get OpenBSD to boot, the boot loaders (biosboot(8) and <tt>/boot</tt>
in the case of i386/amd64) and the kernel (<tt>/bsd</tt>) must be within the
boot ROM's supported range, and within their own abilities.
To play it safe, the rule is simple:

<blockquote>
<b>The entire root partition must be within the computer's BIOS
(or boot ROM) addressable space.</b>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some non-i386 users think they are immune to this, however most platforms
have some kind of boot ROM limitation on disk size.
Finding out for sure what the limit is, however, can be difficult.

<p>
This is another good reason to <a href="faq4.html#Partitioning">partition 
your hard disk</a>, rather than using one large partition.

<h3>fsck(8) time and memory requirements</h3>
Another consideration with large file systems is the time and memory
required to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fsck&amp;sektion=8">fsck(8)</a>
the file system after a crash or power interruption.
One should not put a 120G file system on a system with 32M of RAM and
expect it to successfully fsck(8) after a crash.
A rough guideline is the system should have at least 1M of available
memory for every 1G of disk space to successfully fsck the disk.
Swap can be used here, but at a very significant performance penalty,
so severe that it is usually unacceptable, except in special cases. 

<p>
The time required to fsck the drive may become a problem as the file
system size expands, but you only have to fsck the disk space that is 
actually allocated to mounted filesystems.
This is another reason NOT to allocate all your disk space Just Because
It Is There.
Keeping file systems mounted RO or not mounted helps keep them from
needing to be fsck(8)ed after tripping over the power cord.
Reducing the number of inodes (using the -i option of newfs) can also
improve fsck time -- assuming you really don't need them.

<p>
Don't forget that if you have multiple disks on the system, they could
all end up being fsck(8)ed after a crash at the same time, so they could
require more RAM than a single disk.

<h3>FFS vs. FFS2</h3>
Using FFS, OpenBSD supports an individual file system of up to
2<sup>31</sup>-1, or 2,147,483,647 blocks, and as each block is 512
bytes, that's a tiny amount less than 1T.
FFS2 is capable of much larger file systems, though other limits will be
reached long before the file system limits will be reached.

<p>
The boot/installation kernels <i>only support FFS</i>, not FFS2, so key
system partitions (<tt>/, /usr, /var, /tmp</tt>) should not be FFS2, or
severe maintenance problems can arise (there should be no reason for
those partitions to be that large, anyway).
For this reason, very large partitions should only be used for
"non-system" partitions, for example, <tt>/home, /var/www/,
/bigarray</tt>, etc.

<p>
Note that not all controllers and drivers support large disks.
For example,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ami&amp;sektion=4">ami(4)</a>
has a limit of 2TB per logical volume.
Always be aware of what was available when a controller or interface was
manufactured, and don't just rely on "the connectors fit".

<p>
<h3>Larger than 2TB disks</h3>
The MBR system used on PCs only directly understands disks up to 2TB in
size.
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&amp;sektion=8">fdisk(8)</a>
will show larger than 2TB disks as 2TB.
This does not in any way hinder OpenBSD's ability to utilize larger
disks, as the MBR is used only to bootstrap the OS, once the OS is
running, the file systems are defined by the disklabel, which does not
have a 2TB limit.

<p>
To use a larger than 2TB disk, create an OpenBSD partition on the disk
using fdisk, whatever size fdisk will let you.
When you label the disk with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&amp;sektion=8">disklabel(8)</a>,
use the "b" option to set the OpenBSD boundaries (which defaulted to
the size of the OpenBSD fdisk partition) to cover the entire disk.
Now you can create your partitions as you wish.
You must still respect the abilities of your BIOS, which will have the
limitation of only understanding fdisk partitions, so your 'a'
partition should be entirely within the fdisk-managed part of the disk,
in addition to any BIOS limitations.


<h2 id="InstBoot">14.9 - Installing Bootblocks (most, but not all platforms)</h2>

<p>
OpenBSD has a very robust boot
loader that is quite indifferent to drive geometries,
however, it is sensitive to where the file
<tt><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386"
>/boot</a></tt> resides on the disk.
If you do something that causes boot(8) to be moved to a new place on
the disk (actually, a new inode), you will "break" your system,
preventing it from booting properly.
To fix your boot block so that you can boot normally, just use any boot
media (CD, floppy, network, USB) to get a <tt>boot&gt;</tt> prompt, then
type "<tt>boot hd0a:/bsd</tt>" to force it to boot from the first hard
disk (and not the boot media).
Your machine should come up normally.
You now need to reinstall the first-stage boot loader
(<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=biosboot&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386"
>biosboot(8)</a>) based on the position of the <tt>/boot</tt>
file, using the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=installboot&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386"
>installboot(8)</a> program.

<p>
Our example will assume your boot disk is sd0 (but
for IDE it would be wd0, etc.):

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>installboot sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

installboot(8) copies over a new second stage boot loader to <tt>/boot</tt>
and installs the first stage boot loader to look for it in the right
place.

<h2 id="Backup">14.10 - Preparing for disaster: Backing up and Restoring from tape</h2>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p>
If you plan on running what might be called a production server, it is
advisable to have some form of backup in the event one of your fixed
disk drives fails, or the data is otherwise lost.

<p>
This information will assist you in using the standard
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dump&amp;sektion=8">dump(8)</a>/<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=restore&amp;sektion=8">restore(8)</a>
utilities provided with OpenBSD.
More advanced backup utilities, such as
"<a href="http://www.amanda.org">Amanda</a>"
and "<a href="http://www.bacula.org">Bacula</a>"
are available through
<a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">packages</a> for backing up multiple servers to
disk and tape.

<h3>Backing up to tape:</h3>

<p>
Backing up to tape requires knowledge of where your file systems are
mounted. You can determine how your filesystems are mounted using the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mount&amp;sektion=8">mount(8)</a>
command at your shell prompt. You should get output similar to this:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mount</b>
/dev/sd0a on / type ffs (local)
/dev/sd0h on /usr type ffs (local)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In this example, the root (/) filesystem resides physically on sd0a
which indicates a SCSI-like fixed disk 0, partition a. The /usr filesystem
resides on sd0h, which indicates SCSI-like fixed disk 0, partition h.

<p>
Another example of a more advanced mount table might be:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mount</b>
/dev/sd0a on / type ffs (local)
/dev/sd0d on /var type ffs (local)
/dev/sd0e on /home type ffs (local)
/dev/sd0h on /usr type ffs (local)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In this more advanced example, the root (/) filesystem resides
physically on sd0a. The /var filesystem resides on sd0d, the /home
filesystem on sd0e and finally /usr on sd0h.

<p>
To backup your machine you will need to feed dump the name of each fixed
disk partition. Here is an example of the commands needed to backup the
simpler mount table listed above:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>/sbin/dump -0au -f /dev/nrst0 /dev/rsd0a</b>
# <b>/sbin/dump -0au -f /dev/nrst0 /dev/rsd0h</b>
# <b>mt -f /dev/rst0 rewind  </b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
For the more advanced mount table example, you would use something
similar to:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>/sbin/dump -0au -f /dev/nrst0 /dev/rsd0a</b>
# <b>/sbin/dump -0au -f /dev/nrst0 /dev/rsd0d</b>
# <b>/sbin/dump -0au -f /dev/nrst0 /dev/rsd0e</b>
# <b>/sbin/dump -0au -f /dev/nrst0 /dev/rsd0h  </b>
# <b>mt -f /dev/rst0 rewind  </b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
You can review the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dump&amp;sektion=8">dump(8)</a>
man page to learn exactly what each command line switch does. Here is a
brief description of the parameters used above:

<ul>
<li><b>0</b> - Perform a level 0 dump, get everything
<li><b>a</b> - Attempt to automatically determine tape media length
<li><b>u</b> - Update the file /etc/dumpdates to indicate when backup was last performed
<li><b>f</b> - Which tape device to use (/dev/nrst0 in this case)
</ul>

<p>
Finally which partition to backup (/dev/rsd0a, etc.)

<p>
The
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mt&amp;sektion=1">mt(1)</a>
command is used at the end to rewind the drive. Review the mt man page
for more options (such as eject).

<p>
If you are unsure of your tape device name, use dmesg to locate it. An
example tape drive entry in dmesg might appear similar to:

<blockquote><pre>
st0 at scsibus0 targ 5 lun 0: &lt;ARCHIVE, Python 28388-XXX, 5.28&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
You may have noticed that when backing up, the tape drive is accessed as
device name "<tt>nrst0</tt>" instead of the "<tt>st0</tt>" name that is seen in dmesg.
When you access <tt>st0</tt> as <tt>nrst0</tt> you are accessing the same physical tape
drive but telling the drive to not rewind at the end of the job and
access the device in raw mode. To back up multiple file systems to a
single tape, be sure you use the non-rewind device, if you use a rewind
device (<tt>rst0</tt>) to back up multiple file systems, you'll end up
overwriting the prior filesystem with the next one dump tries to write
to tape. You can find a more elaborate description of various tape drive
devices in the dump man page.

<p>
If you wanted to write a small script called "backup", it might look
something like this:

<blockquote><pre>
echo "  Starting Full Backup..."
/sbin/dump -0au -f /dev/nrst0 /dev/rsd0a
/sbin/dump -0au -f /dev/nrst0 /dev/rsd0d
/sbin/dump -0au -f /dev/nrst0 /dev/rsd0e
/sbin/dump -0au -f /dev/nrst0 /dev/rsd0h
echo
echo -n "  Rewinding Drive, Please wait..."
mt -f /dev/rst0 rewind
echo "Done."
echo
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If scheduled nightly backups are desired,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cron&amp;sektion=8">cron(8)</a>
could be used to launch your backup script automatically.

<p>
It will also be helpful to document (on a scrap of paper) how large each
file system needs to be. You can use "<tt>df -h</tt>" to determine how much space
each partition is currently using. This will be handy when the drive
fails and you need to recreate your partition table on the new drive.

<p>
Restoring your data will also help reduce fragmentation. To ensure you
get all files, the best way of backing up is rebooting your system in
single user mode. File systems do not need to be mounted to be backed
up. Don't forget to mount root (/) r/w after rebooting in single user
mode or your dump will fail when trying to write out dumpdates. Enter
"<tt>bsd -s</tt>" at the boot&gt; prompt for single user mode.


<h3>Viewing the contents of a dump tape:</h3>

<p>
After you've backed up your file systems for the first time, it would be
a good idea to briefly test your tape and be sure the data on it is as
you expect it should be.

<p>
You can use the following example to review a catalog of files on a dump
tape:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>/sbin/restore -tvs 1 -f /dev/rst0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This will cause a list of files that exist on the 1st partition of the
dump tape to be listed. Following along from the above examples, 1 would
be your root (/) file system.

<p>
To see what resides on the 2nd tape partition and send the output to a
file, you would use a command similar to:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>/sbin/restore -tvs 2 -f /dev/rst0 > /home/me/list.txt</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you have a mount table like the simple one, 2 would be /usr, if yours
is a more advanced mount table 2 might be /var or another fs. The
sequence number matches the order in which the file systems are written
to tape.


<h3>Restoring from tape:</h3>

<p>
The example scenario listed below would be useful if your fixed drive
has failed completely. In the event you want to restore a single file
from tape, review the restore man page and pay attention to the
interactive mode instructions.

<p>
If you have prepared properly, replacing a disk and restoring your data
from tape can be a very quick process. The standard OpenBSD install/boot
CD already contains the required restore utility as well as the
binaries required to partition and make your new drive bootable. In most
cases, a CD and your most recent dump tape is all you'll need to
get back up and running.

<p>
After physically replacing the failed disk drive, the basic steps to
restore your data are as follows:

<ul>
<li>
<p>
Boot from the OpenBSD install/boot floppy. At the menu selection, choose
Shell. Write protect and insert your most recent back up tape into the
drive.
<br>
<li>
<p>
Using the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">fdisk(8)</a>
command, create a primary OpenBSD partition on this newly installed
drive. Example:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -e sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
See <a href="#fdisk">fdisk FAQ</a> for more info.

<li>
<p>
Using the disklabel command, recreate your OpenBSD partition table
inside that primary OpenBSD partition you just created with fdisk.
Example:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>disklabel -E sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
(Don't forget swap, see <a href="#disklabel">disklabel FAQ</a> for more
info)

<li>
<p>
Use the newfs command to build a clean file system on each partition you
created in the above step. Example:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>newfs /dev/rsd0a</b>
# <b>newfs /dev/rsd0h</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li>
<p>
Mount your newly prepared root (/) file system on /mnt. Example:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mount /dev/sd0a /mnt</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li>
<p>
Change into that mounted root file system and start the restore process.
Example:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /mnt</b>
# <b>restore -rs 1 -f /dev/rst0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li>
<p>
You'll want this new disk to be bootable, use the following to write a
new MBR to your drive. Example:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -i sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li>
<p>
In addition to writing a new MBR to the drive, you will need to install
boot blocks to boot from it. The following is a brief example:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>installboot -v -r /mnt sd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li>
<p>
Your new root file system on the fixed disk should be ready enough so
you can boot it and continue restoring the rest of your file systems.
Since your operating system is not complete yet, be sure you boot back
up with single user mode. At the shell prompt, issue the following
commands to unmount and halt the system:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>umount /mnt</b>
# <b>halt</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li>
<p>
Remove the install/boot floppy from the drive and reboot your system. At
the OpenBSD boot&gt; prompt, issue the following command:

<blockquote><pre>
boot&gt; <b>bsd -s</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The bsd -s will cause the kernel to be started in single user mode which
will only require a root (/) file system.

<li>
<p>
Assuming you performed the above steps correctly and nothing has gone
wrong you should end up at a prompt asking you for a shell path or press
return. Press return to use sh. Next, you'll want to remount root in r/w
mode as opposed to read only. Issue the following command:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mount -u -w /</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li>
<p>
Once you have re-mounted in r/w mode you can continue restoring your
other file systems. Example:

<blockquote><pre>
<i>(simple mount table)</i>
# <b>mount /dev/sd0h /usr; cd /usr; restore -rs 2 -f /dev/rst0</b>

<i>(more advanced mount table)</i>
# <b>mount /dev/sd0d /var; cd /var; restore -rs 2 -f /dev/rst0</b>
# <b>mount /dev/sd0e /home; cd /home; restore -rs 3 -f /dev/rst0</b>
# <b>mount /dev/sd0h /usr; cd /usr; restore -rs 4 -f /dev/rst0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
You could use "<b>restore rvsf</b>" instead of just rsf to view names of
objects as they are extracted from the dump set.

<li>
<p>
Finally after you finish restoring all your other file systems to disk,
reboot into multiuser mode. If everything went as planned your system
will be back to the state it was in as of your most recent back up tape
and ready to use again.
</ul>

<h2 id="MountImage">14.11 - Mounting disk images in OpenBSD</h2>

<p>
To mount a disk image (ISO images, disk images created with dd, etc.) in
OpenBSD you must configure a
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vnd&amp;sektion=4">vnd(4)</a>
device. For example, if you have an ISO image located at
<i>/tmp/ISO.image</i>, you would take the following steps to mount the
image.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>vnconfig vnd0 /tmp/ISO.image</b>
# <b>mount -t cd9660 /dev/vnd0c /mnt</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Notice that since this is an ISO-9660 image, as used by CDs and DVDs,
you must specify type of
<i>cd9660</i> when mounting it. This is true, no matter what type, e.g.
you must use type <i>ext2fs</i> when mounting Linux disk images.

<p>
To unmount the image use the following commands.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>umount /mnt</b>
# <b>vnconfig -u vnd0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
For more information, refer to the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vnconfig&amp;sektion=8">vnconfig(8)</a>
man page.

<h2 id="pciideErr">14.12 - Help! I'm getting errors with IDE DMA!</h2>

<p>
DMA IDE transfers, supported by 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pciide&amp;sektion=4">pciide(4)</a>
are unreliable with many combinations of older hardware.

<p>
OpenBSD is aggressive and attempts to use the highest DMA Mode it can
configure. This will cause corruption of data transfers in some
configurations because of buggy motherboard chipsets, buggy drives,
and/or noise on the cables. Luckily, Ultra-DMA modes protect data
transfers with a CRC to detect corruption. When the Ultra-DMA CRC fails,
OpenBSD will print an error message and try the operation again.

<blockquote><pre>
wd2a:  aborted command, interface CRC error reading fsbn 64 of 64-79
(wd2 bn 127; cn 0 tn 2 sn 1), retrying
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
After failing a couple times, OpenBSD will downgrade to a slower
(hopefully more reliable) Ultra-DMA mode. If Ultra-DMA mode 0 is hit,
then the drive downgrades to PIO mode.

<p>
UDMA errors are often caused by low quality or damaged cables.
Cable problems should usually be the first suspect if you get many
DMA errors or unexpectedly low DMA performance.
It is also a bad idea to put the CD-ROM on the same channel with a hard
disk.

<p>
If replacing cables does not resolve the problem and OpenBSD does not
successfully downgrade, or the process causes your machine to lock hard,
or causes excessive messages on the console and in the logs, you may
wish to force the system to use a lower level of DMA or UDMA by default.
This can be done by using <a href="faq5.html#BootConfig">UKC</a> or
<a href="faq5.html#config">config(8)</a> to change the flags on the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=wd&amp;sektion=4">wd(4)</a>
device.


<h2 id="NegSpace">14.14 - Why does <tt>df(1)</tt> tell me I have over 100% of my disk
used?</h2>
People are sometimes surprised to find they have <i>negative</i>
available disk space, or more than 100% of a filesystem in use, as shown
by
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=df&amp;sektion=1">df(1)</a>.

<p>
When a filesystem is created with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=newfs&amp;sektion=8">newfs(8)</a>,
some of the available space is held in reserve from normal users.
This provides a margin of error when you accidently fill the disk, and
helps keep disk fragmentation to a minimum.
Default for this is 5% of the disk capacity, so if the root user has
been carelessly filling the disk, you may see up to 105% of the
available capacity in use.

<p>
If the 5% value is not appropriate for you, you can change it with the

command.

<h2 id="OhBugger">14.15 - Recovering partitions after deleting the disklabel</h2>

<p>
If you have a damaged partition table, there are various things
you can attempt to do to recover it.

<p>
Firstly, panic.
You usually do so anyways, so you might as well get it over with.
Just don't do anything stupid.
Panic away from your machine.
Then relax, and see if the steps below won't help you out.

<p>
A copy of the disklabel for each disk is saved
in <tt>/var/backups</tt> as part of the daily system maintenance.
Assuming you still have the var partition, you can simply read the
output, and put it back into disklabel.

<p>
In the event that you can no longer see that partition, there are two
options.
Fix enough of the disc so you can see it, or fix enough of the disc so
that you can get your data off.

Depending on what happened, one or other of those may be preferable
(with dying discs you want the data first, with sloppy fingers you can
just have the label)

<p>

The first tool you need is
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=scan_ffs">scan_ffs(8)</a>
(note the underscore, it isn't called "scanffs").
scan_ffs(8) will look through a disc, and try and find partitions and
also tell you what information it finds about them.
You can use this information to recreate the disklabel.
If you just want <tt>/var</tt> back, you can recreate the partition for
<tt>/var</tt>, and then recover the backed up label and add the rest
from that.

<p>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel;sektion=8">disklabel(8)</a>
will update both the kernel's understanding of the disklabel, and
then attempt to write the label to disk.
Therefore, even if the area of the disk containing the disklabel is
unreadable, you will be able to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mount;sektion=8">mount(8)</a>
it until the next reboot.

<h2 id="foreignfs">14.16 - Can I access data on filesystems other than FFS?</h2>
<!-- This article written by Steven Mestdagh,
steven@openbsd.org, and released under the BSD license -->

Yes. Other supported filesystems include: ext2/3/4 (Linux), ISO9660 and UDF
(CD-ROM, DVD media), FAT (MS-DOS and Windows), NFS, NTFS (Windows).
Some of them have limited support; for instance read-only.

<p>
We will give a general overview on how to use one of these filesystems
under OpenBSD. To be able to use a filesystem, it must be mounted.
For details and mount options, please consult the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mount&amp;sektion=8">mount(8)</a>
manual page, and that of the mount command for the filesystem you will be
mounting, e.g. mount_msdos, mount_ext2fs, ...

<p>
First, you must know on which device your filesystem is located. This can be
simply your first hard disk, <tt>wd0</tt> or <tt>sd0</tt>, but it may be
less obvious.
All recognized and configured devices on your system are mentioned in the
output of the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=1">dmesg(1)</a>
command: a device name, followed by a one-line description of the device.
For example, my first CD-ROM drive is recognized as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
cd0 at scsibus0 targ 0 lun 0: &lt;COMPAQ, DVD-ROM LTD163, GQH3&gt; SCSI0 5/cdrom removable
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
For a much shorter list of available disks, you can use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysctl&amp;sektion=8">sysctl(8)</a>.
The command

<blockquote><pre>
# sysctl hw.disknames
</pre></blockquote>

will show all disks currently known to your system, for example:

<blockquote><pre>
hw.disknames=cd0:,cd1:,wd0:,fd0:,cd2:
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
At this point, it is time to find out which partitions are on the device, and
in which partition the desired filesystem resides.
Therefore, we examine the device using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&amp;sektion=8">disklabel(8)</a>.
The disklabel contains a list of partitions, with a maximum number of 16.
Partition c always indicates the entire device.
Partitions a-b and d-p are used by OpenBSD.
Partitions i-p may be automatically allocated to file systems of other
operating systems.
In this case, I'll be viewing the disklabel of my hard disk, which contains
a number of different filesystems.

<p>
<b>NOTE: OpenBSD was installed after the other operating systems</b>
on this system, and during the install a disklabel containing partitions for
the native as well as the foreign filesystems was installed on the disk.
However, if you install foreign filesystems after the OpenBSD disklabel
was already installed on the disk, you need to add or modify them manually
afterwards. This will be explained in <a href="#foreignfsafter">this
subsection</a>.

<blockquote><pre>

  o:      13783707      64372518  ext2fs 

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
As can be seen in the above output, the OpenBSD partitions are listed first.
Next to them are a number of ext2 partitions and one MSDOS partition, as
well as a few 'unknown' partitions. On i386 and amd64 systems, you can
usually find out more about those using the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">fdisk(8)</a>
utility.
For the curious reader: partition i is a maintenance partition created by
the vendor, partition j is a NTFS partition and partition l is a Linux swap
partition.

<p>
Once you have determined which partition it is you want to use, you can
move to the final step: mounting the filesystem contained in it.
Most filesystems are supported in the GENERIC kernel: just have a look at
the kernel configuration file, located in the
<tt>/usr/src/sys/arch/&lt;<i>arch</i>&gt;/conf</tt> directory.
If you want to use one of the filesystems not supported in GENERIC, you
will need to <a href="faq5.html#Options">build a custom kernel</a>.

<p>
When you have gathered the information needed as mentioned above, it is
time to mount the filesystem.
Let's assume a directory <tt>/mnt/otherfs</tt> exists, which we will use as
a mount point where we will mount the desired filesystem.
In this example, we will mount the ext2 filesystem in partition m:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mount -t ext2fs /dev/wd0m /mnt/otherfs</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you plan to use this filesystem regularly, you may save yourself some
time by inserting a line for it in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>, for example something
like:

<blockquote><pre>
/dev/wd0m /mnt/otherfs ext2fs rw,noauto,nodev,nosuid 0 0
</pre></blockquote>

Notice the 0 values in the fifth and sixth field.
This means we do not require the filesystem to be dumped, and checked using
fsck.
Generally, those are things you want to have handled by the native
operating system associated with the filesystem.

<h3 id="foreignfsafter">14.16.1 - The partitions are not in my disklabel! What should I do?</h3>

If you install foreign filesystems on your system (often the result of
adding a new operating system) after you have already installed OpenBSD,
a disklabel will already be present, and it will not be updated
automatically to contain the new foreign filesystem partitions.
If you wish to use them, you need to add or modify these partitions
manually using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&amp;sektion=8">disklabel(8)</a>.

<p>
As an example, I have modified one of my existing ext2 partitions: using
Linux's fdisk program, I've reduced the size of the 'o' partition (see
disklabel output above) to 1G.
We will be able to recognize it easily by its starting position
(offset: 64372518) and size (13783707).
Note that these values are sector numbers, and that using sector numbers
(not megabytes or any other measure) is the most exact and safest way of
reading this information.

<p>
Before the change, the partition looked like this using OpenBSD's
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">fdisk(8)</a>
utility (leaving only relevant output):

<blockquote><pre>
# fdisk wd0
. . .
Offset: 64372455        Signature: 0xAA55
         Starting       Ending       LBA Info:
 #: id    C   H  S -    C   H  S [       start:      size   ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 0: 83 4007   1  1 - 4864 254 63 [    64372518:    13783707 ] Linux files*
. . .
</pre></blockquote>

As you can see, the starting position and size are exactly those reported
by disklabel(8) earlier.
(Dont' be confused by the value indicated by "Offset": it is referring to
the starting position of the extended partition in which the ext2 partition
is contained.)

<p>
After changing the partition's size from Linux, it looks like this:

<blockquote><pre>
# fdisk wd0
. . .
Offset: 64372455        Signature: 0xAA55
         Starting       Ending       LBA Info:
 #: id    C   H  S -    C   H  S [       start:      size   ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 0: 83 4007   1  1 - 4137 254 63 [    64372518:     2104452 ] Linux files*
. . .
</pre></blockquote>

Now this needs to be changed using disklabel(8).
For instance, you can issue <tt>disklabel -e wd0</tt>, which will invoke
an editor specified by the EDITOR environment variable (default is vi).
Within the editor, change the last line of the disklabel to match the new
size:

<blockquote><pre>
  o:       2104452      64372518  ext2fs
</pre></blockquote>

Save the disklabel to disk when finished.
Now that the disklabel is up to date again, you should be able to mount
your partitions as described above.

<p>
You can follow a very similar procedure to add new partitions.

<h2 id="flashmem">14.17 - Can I use a flash memory device with OpenBSD?</h2>
<h3 id="flashmemPortable">14.17.1 - Flash memory as a portable storage device</h3>
<!-- This article written by Steven Mestdagh,
steven@openbsd.org, and released under the BSD license -->

Normally, the memory device should be recognized upon plugging it into a
port of your machine.
Shortly after inserting it, a number of messages are written to the console
by the kernel.
For instance, when I plug in my USB flash memory device, I see the following
on my console:

<blockquote><pre>
umass0 at uhub1 port 1 configuration 1 interface 0
umass0: LEXR PLUG DRIVE LEXR PLUG DRIVE, rev 1.10/0.01, addr 2
umass0: using SCSI over Bulk-Only
scsibus2 at umass0: 2 targets
sd0 at scsibus2 targ 1 lun 0: &lt;LEXAR, DIGITAL FILM, /W1.&gt; SCSI2 0/direct removable
sd0: 123MB, 512 bytes/sec, 251904 sec total
</pre></blockquote>

These lines indicate that the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=umass&amp;sektion=4">umass(4)</a>
(USB mass storage) driver has been attached to the memory device, and that
it is using the SCSI system.
The last two lines are the most important ones: they are saying to which
device node the memory device has been attached, and what the total amount of
storage space is.
If you somehow missed these lines, you can still see them afterwards with the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=1">dmesg(1)</a>
command.
The reported CHS geometry is a rather fictitious one, as the flash memory
is being treated like any regular SCSI disk.

<p>
We will discuss two scenarios below.

<h4>The device is new/empty and you want to use it with OpenBSD only</h4>

You will need to initialize a disklabel onto the device, and create at
least one partition.
Please read <a href="#disklabel">Using OpenBSD's disklabel</a> and the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&amp;sektion=8">disklabel(8)</a>
manual page for details about this.

<p>
In this example I created just one partition <i>a</i> in which I will place
a FFS filesystem:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>newfs sd0a</b>
Warning: inode blocks/cyl group (125) >= data blocks (62) in last
    cylinder group. This implies 1984 sector(s) cannot be allocated.
/dev/rsd0a:     249856 sectors in 122 cylinders of 64 tracks, 32 sectors
        122.0MB in 1 cyl groups (122 c/g, 122.00MB/g, 15488 i/g)
super-block backups (for fsck -b #) at:
 32,
</pre></blockquote>

Let's mount the filesystem we created in the <i>a</i> partition on
<tt>/mnt/flashmem</tt>.
Create the mount point first if it does not exist.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mkdir /mnt/flashmem</b>
# <b>mount /dev/sd0a /mnt/flashmem</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h4>You received the memory device from someone with whom you want to exchange data</h4>

<p>
There is a considerable chance the other person is not using OpenBSD, so there
may be a foreign filesystem on the memory device.
Therefore, we will first need to find out which partitions are on the device,
as described in <a href="#foreignfs">FAQ 14 - Foreign Filesystems</a>.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>disklabel sd0</b>

# /dev/rsd0c:
type: SCSI
disk: SCSI disk
label: DIGITAL FILM    
flags:
bytes/sector: 512
sectors/track: 32
tracks/cylinder: 64
sectors/cylinder: 2048
cylinders: 123
total sectors: 251904
rpm: 3600
interleave: 1
trackskew: 0
cylinderskew: 0
headswitch: 0           # microseconds
track-to-track seek: 0  # microseconds
drivedata: 0 

16 partitions:
#             size        offset  fstype [fsize bsize  cpg]
  c:        251904             0  unused      0     0      # Cyl     0 -   122 
  i:        250592            32   MSDOS                   # Cyl     0*-   122*
</pre></blockquote>

As can be seen in the disklabel output above, there is only one partition
<i>i</i>, containing a FAT filesystem created on a Windows machine.
As usual, the <i>c</i> partition indicates the entire device.

<p>
Let's now mount the filesystem in the <i>i</i> partition on
<tt>/mnt/flashmem</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>mount -t msdos /dev/sd0i /mnt/flashmem</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Now you can start using it just like any other disk.

<p>
<b>WARNING:</b>
You should <b>always unmount</b> the filesystem <b>before unplugging</b> the
memory device.
If you don't, the filesystem may be left in an inconsistent state, which
may result in data corruption.

<p>
Upon detaching the memory device from your machine, you will again see the
kernel write messages about this to the console:

<blockquote><pre>
umass0: at uhub1 port 1 (addr 2) disconnected
sd0 detached
scsibus2 detached
umass0 detached
</pre></blockquote>

<h3 id="flashmemBoot">14.17.2 - Flash memory as bootable storage</h3>
<!-- This article written by Nick Holland
nick@openbsd.org, and released under the BSD license -->
One can also use flash memory in various forms as bootable disk with
OpenBSD.
This can be done with both USB devices (assuming your computer can
boot from a USB flash device, not all can), or with a non-USB (i.e.,
CF) device with an IDE or SATA adapter.
(Non-USB devices attached with a USB adapter are treated as USB devices.)
In some cases, you may actually use a device in both ways (load the
media in a USB adapter, but run it in an IDE adapter).

<p>
A flash device attached to a USB port will show up as a
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sd&amp;sektion=4">sd(4)</a>
SCSI-like device.
When attached to an IDE adapter, it will show up as a 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=wd&amp;sektion=4">wd(4)</a>
device.

<p>
In the case of flash media in an IDE adapter, it can be booted from
any system that could boot from an IDE hard disk on the same adapter.
In every sense, the system sees the flash media as an IDE disk.
Simply configure the hardware appropriately, then install OpenBSD
to the flash disk as normal.

<p>
In the case of booting from a USB device, your system must be
able to boot from the USB device without being distracted by
other devices on the system.
Note that if your intention is to make a portable boot environment on a
USB device, you really want to use <a href="#DUID">DUIDs</a>, rather
than the traditional "<tt>/dev/sd0X</tt>" notation.
The USB device will show up as a SCSI disk, sometimes sd0.
Without DUIDs, if you plug this device into a system which already has a few
SCSI-like disks (i.e., devices attached to an ahci(4) interface) on it,
it will probably end up with a different
identifier, which will complicate carrying the flash device from system
to system, as you would have to update <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>.
Using DUIDs completely resolves this issue.

<p>
Some notes:
<ul>
<li><b>Speed:</b> In general, flash devices are much slower than hard disks,
especially when it comes to writing.
Using <a href="#SoftUpdates">soft updates</a> will help this
considerably, as will using the "noatime" mount option.

<li><b>"Write fatigue":</b>
Much has been written about the finite number of times an individual
flash cell can be rewritten before failure.
Practically speaking, however, there are many ways a flash device can
fail, write fatigue is just one of them.
Modern flash devices will verify writes, and in the event of failure,
will automatically remap the failed sectors with one of the many spare
sectors.
Most users with most flash devices will not have to worry about "write
fatigue".
You would probably experience more down time due to failure of "clever"
tricks done to avoid writing to the flash drive than you will by just
using the drives as read-write media.

<li><b>Reliability:</b>
The fact that flash media has no moving parts has prompted many people
to assume the flash media is inherently more reliable than hard disks.
It is not wise to assume that switching to flash means you
don't need to worry about data loss or drive failure.
People have reported considerable variation in flash media quality,
it is probably best to consider flash storage as a silent and low-power
alternative to disk rather than a failure-free storage media.

<li><b>Creating a bootable USB flash drive:</b>
While a USB device can only be booted on a machine which can boot from
USB drives, it can be created on any machine with supported USB
hardware.
You will, of course, be unable to test your work until you can get to a
USB bootable system.

<li><b>Going from IDE to USB interfaces:</b>
Since flash media can be readable and writable through USB, IDE and 
other adapters, you can create bootable media with one type of adapter
but maintain or use it with another type of adapter.

<li><b>Mixing OpenBSD and other partitions on one device:</b>
OpenBSD treats the flash disk as any other disk so one can use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&amp;sektion=8">fdisk(8)</a>
to partition a flash device, as you would any hard disk.
You can then have OpenBSD file systems on one partition, and use another
partition for another file system, for example, FAT32.
However, not all OSs treat USB devices as "equals".
Windows, at least, will not attempt to use or create a partition that
doesn't start at the beginning of the device, nor will the Windows
partitioning tools allow you to partition the disk, though it will
respect existing partitions.
So, if you wish to create a USB flash drive that is bootable with
OpenBSD, but also functions as a FAT32-capable device on other OSs, you
would want to do something like this:

  <ol>
  <li>Partition the media with OpenBSD's fdisk, creating a partition
    of the type you desire for Windows to use at the beginning of the
    disk, and an OpenBSD partition at the end of the disk.
  <li>Install OpenBSD as normal to the OpenBSD fdisk partition, don't
    forget to flag the OpenBSD partition as "Active" for booting.
  <li>Format the other partition.
    This can be (and perhaps should be) done on the "target" OS
    (Windows, in this case).
  </ol>

Note that if the other partition's type is chosen appropriately, it is
possible to have OpenBSD access both partitions on the device.
So, a Windows user could populate the FAT32 partition with MP3 files
which could be played when they booted from the OpenBSD partition.

</ul>

<h3 id="flashmemLive">14.17.3 - How do I create a bootable "Live" USB device?</h3>
It is very easy to create a bootable USB flash (or other!) drive that
can be used as a "live" OpenBSD system without installing OpenBSD on
the local hard disk of a machine.
Obviously, the target machine must be bootable from a USB device, but
the initial load can actually be done from any machine with a USB
interface.

<p>
Some reasons you may want to do this:
<ul>
<li>A portable, secure "machine" you can carry with you in your pocket.

<li>Fix problems in OpenBSD and other installs with tools that aren't
available with <a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a>.

<li>Evaluate hardware for OpenBSD compatibility at the point of purchase.

<li>Install machines that lack any other form of boot media.

<li>Collect <a href="faq4.html#SendDmesg">dmesg</a> outputs from your
friend's computers!
(As OpenBSD's dmesg is useful for identifying hardware, this can be a
good way to prep for the install of OTHER OSs on a machine -- make sure
you have all the needed drivers before starting).

</ul>

Creating such a "live OpenBSD drive" is simple.
<ul>
<li>Mount your USB drive to the machine you are installing from.
<li>Boot your favorite OpenBSD install media.
<li><a href="faq4.html">Install</a> as normal, being careful to select
your flash drive as the install target.
<li>Boot from your newly created USB device.
</ul>

That's it!

<p>
There are some things you may want to do after the install to improve
your results:

<ul>
<li>Install all packages and utilities you are likely to wish to have
available.
<li>Different target machines will likely have different NICs.
You could create a bunch of
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=hostname.if&amp;sektion=5">hostname.if(5)</a>
files in <tt>/etc</tt>, each containing just <tt>dhcp</tt>, for all the
NICs you are likely to encounter (fxp0, re0, rl0, bge0, bnx0, em0, etc.)
on USB-bootable machines, plus maybe sample wireless config files as
well.
OpenBSD will ignore all hostname.if(5) files for devices not present
at boot time.

<li>You may wish to have a copy of the install files and maybe any
desired package .tgz files so you can use the drive as an install
media (boot bsd.rd instead of letting it boot normally).

<li>On many machines, X will "Just Work" with no config file, but you
may wish to collect X config files for those systems that require them.

<li><a href="#SoftUpdates">Soft updates</a> will be something you will
want to use.

<li>For maximum flexibility, you probably want to use
<a href="../i386.html">i386</a> rather than
<a href="../amd64.html">amd64</a>.
However, if you wish to use it as an install media, you could have an

<h2 id="DiskOpt">14.18 - Optimizing disk performance</h2>

<p>
Disk performance is a significant factor in the overall speed of your
computer.
It becomes increasingly important when your computer is hosting a
multi-user environment (users of all kinds, from those who log-in
interactively to those who see you as a file-server or a web-server).
Data storage constantly needs attention, especially when your partitions
run out of space or when your disks fail.
OpenBSD has a few options to increase the speed of your disk
operations.

<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#Optsoftu">Soft Updates</a>
<li><a href="#Optmaxvnodes">Size of the namei() cache</a>
</ul>

<h3 id="Optsoftu">14.18.1 - Soft updates</h3>

An important tool that can be used to speed up your system is softupdates.
One of the slowest operations in the traditional BSD file system is
updating metainfo (which happens, among other times, when you create or
delete files and directories).
Softupdates attempts to update metainfo in RAM instead of writing to the
hard disk each and every single metainfo update.
Another effect of this is that the metainfo on disk should always be
complete, although not always up to date.
You can read more about softupdates in the
<a href="#SoftUpdates">Softupdates FAQ</a> entry.

<h3 id="Optmaxvnodes">14.18.2 - Size of the namei() cache</h3>

The name-to-inode translation (a.k.a., <!-- need to write the manual
page first... <a href="">namei(3)</a> --> namei()) cache controls
the speed of pathname to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=inode&amp;sektion=5">inode(5)</a>
translation.
A reasonable way to derive a value for the cache, should a large number of namei()
cache misses be noticed with a tool such as
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=systat&amp;sektion=1">systat(1)</a>,
is to examine the system's current computed value with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysctl&amp;sektion=8">sysctl(8)</a>,
(which calls this parameter "<tt>kern.maxvnodes</tt>") and to increase this
value until either the namei() cache hit rate improves or it is determined that
the system does not benefit substantially from an increase in the size of the
namei() cache. After the value has been determined, you can
set it at system startup time with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysctl.conf&amp;sektion=5">sysctl.conf(5)</a>.

<h2 id="Async">14.19 - Why aren't we using async mounts?</h2>

<p>
Question: "I simply do "mount -u -o async /" which makes one package I use
(which insists on touching a few hundred things from time to time) usable.

Why is async mounting frowned upon and not on by default (as it is in some
other unixen)? Isn't it a much simpler, and therefore, a safer way of
improving performance in some applications?"

<p>
Answer: "Async mounts are indeed faster than sync mounts, but they are also
less safe. What happens in case of a power failure? Or a hardware problem?
The quest for speed should not sacrifice the reliability and the stability of
the system. Check the man page for
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mount&amp;sektion=8">mount(8)</a>."

<pre>
             async   All I/O to the file system should be done asynchronously.
                     This is a dangerous flag to set since it does not guaran-
                     tee to keep a consistent file system structure on the
                     disk.  You should not use this flag unless you are pre-
                     pared to recreate the file system should your system
                     crash.  The most common use of this flag is to speed up
                     restore(8) where it can give a factor of two speed in-
                     crease.
</pre>

<p>
On the other hand, when you are dealing with temp data that you can recreate
from scratch after a crash, you can gain speed by using a separate  
partition for that data only, mounted async.  Again, do this <i>only if</i>
you don't mind the loss of all the data in the partition
when something goes wrong. For this reason,  
<a href= "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mfs&amp;sektion=8">mfs(8)</a>
partitions are mounted asynchronously, as
they will get wiped and recreated on a reboot anyway.


<h2 id="altroot">14.20 - Duplicating your root partition: altroot</h2>
OpenBSD provides an "altroot" facility in the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=daily&amp;sektion=8">daily</a>
scripts.
If the environment variable <tt>ROOTBACKUP=1</tt> is set
in either <tt>/etc/daily.local</tt> or root's
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=crontab&amp;sektion=5">crontab(5)</a>,
and a partition is specified in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> as mounting
to <tt>/altroot</tt> with the mount options of "xx", every night
the entire contents of the root partition will be duplicated to the
<tt>/altroot</tt> partition.
Assuming we want to back up our root partition to wd1a, we add the 
following to <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>

<blockquote><pre>
/dev/wd1a /altroot ffs xx 0 0
</pre></blockquote>

and set the appropriate environment variable in <tt>/etc/daily.local</tt>:
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>echo ROOTBACKUP=1 >>/etc/daily.local</b>
</pre></blockquote>

As the altroot process will capture your <tt>/etc</tt> directory, this
will make sure any configuration changes there are updated daily.

<p>
This is a "disk image" copy done with dd(8), not a file-by-file copy, so
your <tt>/altroot</tt> partition should be exactly the same size as your
root partition or larger.
Also, excessively large root partitions should be avoided so the process
does not take too long.

<p>
For full redundancy, the rest of the partitions should be duplicated as
well, using <a href="#softraid">softraid</a> disk, dump(8)/restore(8),
rsync, etc.
It can be done manually, or part of a regular schedule, such as the
<tt>weekly.local</tt>, <tt>daily.local</tt>, or <tt>monthly.local</tt>
scripts.

<p>
Generally, you will want your "altroot" partition to be on a different
disk that has been configured to be fully bootable should the primary
disk fail.
It is possible to have an "altroot" on the same disk as your boot drive,
but the benefit of this is limited.

<p>
Note that we did not specify the altroot device by DUID, but by device
name.
We probably want to be pushing from the boot device to the secondary 
device, which can end up changing if the drive order is changed.
For this reason, you may want to specify the root and altroot in 
<tt>/etc/fstab</tt> as a device name, not a DUID.


<h2 id="softraid">14.21 - How do I use softraid(4)?</h2>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=softraid&amp;sektion=4">Softraid(4)</a> 
works by emulating a 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=scsibus&amp;sektion=4">scsibus(4)</a>
with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sd&amp;sektion=4">sd(4)</a>
devices made by combining a number of OpenBSD
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&amp;sektion=8">disklabel(8)</a>
partitions ("chunks") into a virtual disk ("volume") with the desired
RAID strategy ("discipline"), such as RAID0, RAID1, RAID4, RAID5 or
Crypto.
(Note: only RAID0, RAID1 and Crypto are fully supported at the moment.)

<p>
This virtual disk is treated as any other disk -- first
partitioned with <a href="#fdisk">fdisk(8)</a> (on fdisk platforms)
and then with <a href="#disklabel">disklabel(8)</a>, partitions have file
systems made, mounted, then used.

<p>
<h4>Some words on RAID in general:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Before implementing any RAID solution, understand what it will and
will not do for you.
It is not a replacement for a good backup strategy.
It will not keep your system running through every hardware failure.
It may not keep your system running through a simple disk failure.
In the case of software RAID, it won't guarantee the ability to boot
from the surviving drive if your computer could not otherwise do so.

<li>Before going into production, you must understand how you use your
RAID solution to recover from failures.
The time to do this is BEFORE your system has had a failure event.
Poorly implemented RAID will often cause more down time than it will 
prevent.
This is even more true if it has caused you to become complacent on your
backups or other disaster planning.

<li>The bigger your RAIDed partitions are, the longer it will take to 
recover from an "event".
In other words, this is an especially bad time to allocate all of your 
cheap 500G drives just because they are there.
Remirroring 500G drives takes a much longer time than mirroring the
4G that you actually use.
One advantage of software mirroring is one can control how much of
those "huge" drives is actually used in a RAID set.

<li>There is a reflex to try to RAID as much of your system as possible.
Mirroring your boot partition in a software RAID system is difficult,
and often pointless, as most PC hardware has difficulty booting from any
drive other than its primary boot drive.
Even hardware which CAN boot from other drives will often have difficulty
determining when a drive has failed to avoid booting from it.
OpenBSD's "<a href="#altroot">altroot</a>" system can actually be BETTER
for some applications, as it provides a copy of old configuration
information in case a change does not work quite as intended.

<li>RAID provides redundancy only for the disk system.
Many applications need more redundancy than just the disks, and for some
applications, RAID can be just added complication, rather than a real
benefit.
An example of this is a <a href="faq6.html#CARP">CARP'd</a> set of
firewalls provide complete fail over redundancy.
In this case, adding RAID (either via hardware or softraid) is just
added complication.
</ul>

<h3 id="softraidDI">14.21.1 - Doing the install</h3>
Softraid disk space can be created using free (or added!) chunks of
disk space after install, but that is just a special (and simple)
case of adding softraid during install.

<p>
The tools to assemble your softraid system are in the basic OpenBSD
install (for adding softraid devices after install), but they are
also available on the CD-ROM and <a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a>
installation kernels.
They do not exist on the floppies due to space issues; one simple
work-around is to do a very minimal OpenBSD install from floppy, then
boot from bsd.rd on your installed system and re-build as desired.

<p>
The installation process will be a little different than the standard
OpenBSD <a href="faq4.html">install</a>, as you will want to drop to
the shell and create your softraid(4) drive before doing the install.
Once the softraid(4) disk is created, you will perform the install
relatively normally, placing the partitions you wish to be RAIDed on
the newly configured drive.

<p>
You can pre-create just the RAID partitions and assemble them into a
softraid(4) volume and let the installer do the rest, but it is probably
easier to also manually create your root and swap partitions before
invoking the installer.

<p>
This does mean you will have to carefully set up the disk before
invoking the installer, making sure you manually do a few steps that the
installer normally takes you through.

<p>
The install kernel only has the <tt>/dev</tt> entries for one wd(4)
device and one sd(4) device on boot, so you will need to create more
disk devices to set up your softraid device.

This process is normally done automatically by the installer, but you
haven't yet run the installer, and you will be adding a disk that didn't
exist at boot.
For example, if we needed to support a second and third wd(4) device
and a second sd(4) device (remember, the softraid devices will be sd(4)
devices), you could do the following from the shell prompt:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /dev</b>
# <b>sh MAKEDEV wd1 wd2 sd1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

You now have full support for sd0, sd1, wd0, wd1 and wd2.

<p>
You will need to properly <a href="#fdisk">fdisk(1)</a> the physical
drives (if appropriate for your platform -- make sure you set up the
second disk so it is bootable!) and then use
<a href="#disklabel">disklabel</a> to set up the partitions.

<p>
The fdisk(8) steps below will put an MBR on the disk and an OpenBSD
partition on the disk.
IF you wish to use the entire disk for OpenBSD (i.e., have NOTHING else
on the disk), you can do this with a simple one-liner for each drive:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>fdisk -iy wd0</b>
# <b>fdisk -iy wd1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

(Do be sure you understand what those lines do to any data that was on
your disk before using it blindly!)
Otherwise, you will need to create an OpenBSD partition within the new
disks.

<h4>Create the partitions for softraid</h4>
When creating the softraid(4) partition, give it the type of "RAID"
rather than the normal "4.2BSD" or "swap".
In this case, we will create our desired partitions on wd0:

<ul>
<li>wd0a  500M /
<li>wd0b  500M swap
<li>wd0m  10G RAID
</ul>

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>disklabel -E wd0</b>
Label editor (enter '?' for help at any prompt)
> <b>a a</b>
offset: [64] <b><i>ENTER</i></b> 
size: [30282461] <b>500m</b>
Rounding to cylinder (16065 sectors): 1028096
FS type: [4.2BSD] <b><i>ENTER</i></b> 
> <b>a b</b>
offset: [1028160]  <b><i>ENTER</i></b> 
size: [29254365] <b>500m</b>
Rounding to cylinder (16065 sectors): 1028160
FS type: [swap] <b><i>ENTER</i></b> 
> <b>a m</b>
offset: [3148740]  <b><i>ENTER</i></b>
size: [28226205] <b>10g</b>
Rounding to cylinder (16065 sectors): 20980890
FS type: [4.2BSD] <b>RAID</b>
> <b>q</b>
Write new label?: [y] <b><i>ENTER</i></b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Now, we need to prep out the second disk to match key parts of the first
disk's layout.
Since we are using the <tt>/altroot</tt> system, we will want an 'a'
partition on the secondary disk the same size as the primary's 'a'.
We want the system to run off the second drive as it would the first,
so we will want to have a similar sized swap partition (though a little
bigger or smaller will not hurt).
We will also want a RAID partition the same size as the primary.
If the RAID partitions are not the same size, the smaller of the two
will dictate the final RAID volume size.

<p>
In short...you really want to just repeat the above allocation process
on the second drive, wd1.

<h4>Assembling the RAID volume</h4>
We will assume that your two RAID partitions are on wd0m and wd1m.
Note that the RAID partition letter is arbitrary, it does not need to be
the same letter on the secondary drive, but it will make keeping track
of things that much easier for you if you keep them the same.

<p>
Note that since softraid(4) has to look around a bit to find evidence
of arrays it needs to assemble, if your disk has been used for softraid
previously, you may find it very helpful to use dd(1) to clear the first
megabyte or so from each partition before going any further:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rwd0m bs=1m count=1</b>
   ...
# <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rwd1m bs=1m count=1</b>
   ...
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
We now create our new softraid(4) disk using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=bioctl&amp;sektion=8">bioctl(8)</a>:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>bioctl -c 1 -l /dev/wd0m,/dev/wd1m softraid0</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This creates a RAID1 volume ("<tt>-c 1</tt>"), using the listed
partitions ("<tt>-l /dev/wd0m,/dev/wd1m</tt>"), using the
<tt>softraid0</tt> driver.
If there are no other sd(4) devices on this system, this will become
sd0.
Note that if you are creating multiple RAID devices, either on one disk
or on multiple devices, you are always going to be using the softraid0
virtual disk interface driver, you won't be using "softraid1" or others.
Remember, the "softraid0" there is a virtual RAID controller, you can
hang many virtual disks off this controller.

<p>
This will create a new disk, "sd0" (assuming there are no other sd(4)
devices on your system).
This device will now show on the system console and dmesg as a newly
installed device:

<blockquote><pre>
scsibus1 at softraid0: 1 targets
sd0 at scsibus2 targ 0 lun 0: &lt;OPENBSD, SR RAID 1, 005&gt; SCSI2 0/direct fixed
sd0: 10244MB, 512 bytes/sec, 20980362 sec total
</pre></blockquote>

showing that we now have a new SCSI bus, and a new disk.
This volume will be automatically detected and assembled from this point
onwards when the system boots.

<p>
Because the new device probably has a lot of garbage where you expect
a MBR and disklabel, zeroing the first chunk of the new disk is highly
recommended, if you didn't zero the component parts above:

<blockquote><pre>
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd0c bs=1m count=1
</pre></blockquote>

You are now ready to install OpenBSD on your system.
Perform the install as normal by invoking "install" at the boot media
command prompt.
Be careful to select "custom" layout for disklabel when prompted,
otherwise your RAID partition will be overwritten!
Use the 'n' option of disklabel to define the mount point for your root
partition, and create all the partitions on your new softraid disk (sd0
in our example here) that should be there, rather than on your non-RAID
disks.

<p>
Now you can reboot your system, and if you have done all properly, it
will automatically assemble your RAID set, and mount the appropriate
partitions.

<h3 id="softraidNotes">14.21.3 - Softraid notes</h3>
<h4>Complications when other sd(4) disks exist</h4>
Softraid disks are assembled <i>after</i> all other IDE, SATA, SAS and
SCSI disks are attached.
As a result, if the number of sd(4) devices changes (either by adding
or removing devices -- or if a device fails), the identifier of the
softraid disk will change.
For this reason, it is very important to use <a href="faq14.html#DUID">DUID</a>s
(Disklabel Unique Identifiers) rather than drive names in your
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fstab&amp;sektion=5">fstab(5)</a>
file.

<p>
You may not want to specify the root device by DUID.

<h4>Three disk RAID1?</h4>
Softraid supports RAID1 with more than two "chunks", and the man page
examples show a three disk RAID1 configuration.
RAID1 simply duplicates the data across all the chunks of storage, two
gives full redundancy, three gives additional fault tolerance.
The advantage of RAID1 with three (or more!) disks or chunks is that in
event of one disk failure, you STILL have complete redundancy.
Think of it as a hot spare that doesn't need time to rebuild!
In theory, a three disk RAID1 is slower on writes than a two disk,
though should be much faster on writes than a rebuilding two disk RAID1.

<h3 id="softraidDR">14.21.4 - Disaster recovery</h3>
This is the section you want to skip over, but don't.
This is the reason for RAID -- if disks never failed, you wouldn't add
the complexity of RAID to your system!
Unfortunately, as failures are very difficult to list comprehensively,
there is a strong probability that the event you experience won't be
described exactly here, but if you take the time to understand the
strategies here, and the WHY, hopefully you can use them to recover
from whatever situations come your way.

<p>
Keep in mind, failures are often not simple.
The author of this article had a drive in a hardware RAID solution develop
a short across the power feed, which in addition to the drive itself,
also required replacing the power supply, the RAID enclosure and a power
supply on a second computer he used to verify the drive was actually
dead, and the data from backup as he didn't properly configure the
replacement enclosure.

<p>
The steps needed for system recovery can be performed in 
<a href="faq8.html#LostPW">single user mode</a>, or from the
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">install kernel (bsd.rd)</a>.

<p>
If you plan on practicing softraid recovery (and we HIGHLY suggest you
do so!), you may find it helpful to zero a drive you remove from the
array before you attempt to return it to the array.
Not only does this more accurately simulate replacing the drive with a
new one, it will avoid the confusion that can result when the system
detects the remains of a softraid array.

<p>

Recovery from a failure will often be a two-stage event -- the first
stage is bringing the system back up to a running state, the second
stage is to rebuild the failed array.
The two stages may be separated by some time if you don't have a
replacement drive handy.

<h4>Recovery from drive failure: secondary</h4>
This is relatively easy.
You may have to remove the failed disk to get the system back up.

<p>
When you are ready to repair the system, you will replace the failed
drive, create the RAID and other disklabel partitions, then rebuild the
mirror.
Assuming your RAID volume is <tt>sd0</tt>, and you are replacing the
failed device with <tt>wd1m</tt>, the following process should work:

<ul>
<li>Boot the system back up.
<li>Create appropriate partitions on your new drive
<li>Rebuild your RAID partition:
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>bioctl -R /dev/wd1m sd0</b> 
</pre></blockquote>
<li>reboot
</ul>

<h4>Recovery from drive failure: primary</h4>
Many PC-like computers can not boot from a second drive if the primary
drive has failed, but still attached unless it is so dead it isn't
detected.
Many can not boot from a drive that isn't the "primary", even if there
is no other drive.

<p>
In general, if your primary drive fails, you will have to remove it, and
in many cases "promote" your secondary drive to primary configuration
before the system will boot.
This may involve re-jumpering the disk, plugging the disk into another
port or some other variation.
Of course, what is on the secondary disk has to not only include your RAID
partition, but also has to be functionally bootable.

<p>
Once you have the system back up on the secondary disk and a new
disk in place, you rebuild as above.


<h4>Recovery from "shuffling" your disks</h4>
What if you have four disks in your system, say, sd0, sd1, sd2, and sd3,
and for reasons of hardware replacement or upgrade, you end up with the
drives out of the machine, and lose track of which was which?

<p>
Fortunately, softraid handles this very well, it considers the disks
"roaming", but will successfully rebuild your arrays.
However, the boot disk in the machine has to be bootable, and if you
just made changes in the root partition before doing this, you probably
want to be sure you didn't boot from your altroot partition by mistake.

<h3 id="softraidCrypto">14.21.5 - Softraid Crypto</h3>

Cryptographic softraid(4) volumes are set up rather simply:

<ul>
<li>Create the desired partition with disklabel(8) as type RAID
<li>Zero the head of the partition as above.
<li><tt># <b>bioctl -c C -l /dev/sd0m softraid0</b><br>
New passphrase: <b><i>My Crypto Pass Phrase</i></b><br>
Re-type passphrase: <b><i>My Crypto Pass Phrase</i></b><br>
softraid0: CRYPTO volume attached as sd1</tt>
<li>Zero the first megabyte of the newly created volume so fdisk(8) or
disklabel(8) doesn't get confused<br>
<tt># <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd1c bs=1m count=1</b></tt>
<li>fdisk(8), disklabel(8) and newfs(8) this new volume, sd1 as desired.
</ul>

Once this is set up, you can then "unlock" the crypto volume when desired
with:
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>bioctl -c C -l /dev/sd0m softraid0</b>
Passphrase: <b><i>My Crypto Pass Phrase</i></b>
softraid0: CRYPTO volume attached as sd1
</pre></blockquote>
You can then mount the encrypted volume's partitions using mount as usual.

<p>
To disconnect a crypto volume (rendering it unusable again), dismount
any file systems and use the following (where the encrypted volume is
sd1):
<blockquote><pre>
# <b>bioctl -d sd1</b>
</pre></blockquote>

The man page for this looks a little scary, as the -d command is
described as "deleting" the volume, but in the case of crypto, it just
deactivates encrypted volume so it can't be accessed until it is
activated again with the passphrase.

<p>
Many other options are available with softraid, and new features are
being added and improvements made, so do consult the man pages for
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=bioctl&amp;sektion=8">bioctl(8)</a>
and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=softraid&amp;sektion=4">softraid(4)</a>
on your system.

<h4>I forgot my passphrase!</h4>
Sorry.
This is real encryption, there's not a back door or magic unlocking
tool.
If you lose your passphrase, your data on your softraid crypto volume
will be unusable.
