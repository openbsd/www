<a name="2.8"></a> 
<h2>Upgrading from 2.8</h2>


<a name="2.8.1"></a> 
<h3>2.8.1: New <em>auth</em> group</h3>

<p>A new group, <em>auth</em>, gid 11, has been added to the
system. Add a line like the following to your
<tt>/etc/group</tt>:</p>

<pre>
  auth:*:11:
</pre>

<a name="2.8.2"></a> 
<h3>2.8.2: New <em>wscons</em> console system</h3>

<p>The <em>pcvt</em> console driver has been replaced with the
<em>wscons</em> console system. Before using wscons, you will
need to create the new wscons-related devices. Ensure you have
the latest MAKEDEV installed, then make all devices:</p>

<pre>
 # cp /usr/src/etc/etc.i386/MAKEDEV /dev/MAKEDEV
 # cd /dev
 # ./MAKEDEV all
</pre>

<p>If you are running X, change the Pointer section of your
<em>XF86Config</em> file to contain the following:</p>

<pre>
    Protocol    "wsmouse"
    Device      "/dev/wsmouse"
</pre>

<a name="2.8.3"></a> 
<h3>2.8.3: Kernel compile fails with undefined symbols</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=config&amp;sektion=8">config(8)</a> has been updated. Building with the old
<em>config</em> will result in errors like:</p>
<pre>
  Undefined symbol `_pdevnames_size' referenced
  Undefined symbol `_pdevnames' referenced
</pre>

<p>To correct this, compile and install the new <em>config</em>:</p>
<pre>
  # cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/config
  # make clean &amp;&amp; make depend &amp;&amp; make
  # make install
</pre>

<p>Now, recompile a new kernel as before.</p>

Upgrading from 2.7

<a name="2.7.1"></a>
<h3>
2.7.1: What are the major problems upgrading from 2.7 to 2.8?
</h3>

<p>
A significant gcc change was introduced that makes it all too easy
to generate self-referencing <em>libc</em> libraries. For this reason, upgrades
should follow exactly this procedure:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="upgrade-minifaq.html#1.10">Clean the cruft</a> from your source tree, and fetch
the 2.8 code.</li>

<li>
<p>
 Build and install a new linker. This <strong>must</strong> be done before
a full <em>gcc</em> build.
</p>
<pre>
  $ cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/ld
  $ make clean &amp;&amp; make obj &amp;&amp; make
  $ sudo make install
</pre>
</li>
<li> Build and install the new <em>gcc</em>. Use the
     <a href="upgrade-minifaq.html#1.8">BOOTSTRAP</a> procedure to speed
     things up.
</li>

<li>
<p> Build a new kernel. Do not install it yet </p>
<pre>
  $ cd /usr/src/sys/arch/`machine`/conf
  $ config GENERIC
  $ cd ../compile/GENERIC
  $ make clean &amp;&amp; make depend &amp;&amp; make
</pre>
</li>

<li><p> Because of some libc changes, your machine may hang on startup unless
   your <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> contains <em>lookup file bind</em>.
   Add this line if necessary </p>
<pre>
  # echo &quot;lookup file bind&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/resolv.conf
</pre>
</li>
<li> Install the new kernel and reboot
<pre>
  # cd /usr/src/sys/arch/`machine`/compile/GENERIC
  # mv /bsd /bsd.old
  # mv bsd /bsd
  # chown root.wheel /bsd
  # shutdown -r now
</pre>
<p>
(If this step fails, you can recover by booting the old kernel - bsd.old -
at the <tt>boot&gt;</tt> prompt.)</p>
</li>
<li> 
<p>Build and install the new make (and support files). 
     Do not skip the <tt>make depend</tt> step.
</p>
<pre>
  $ cd /usr/src/usr.bin/make
  $ make clean &amp;&amp; make obj &amp;&amp; make depend &amp;&amp; make
  $ sudo make install
  $ cd /usr/src/share/mk
  $ sudo make install
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Install the latest <em>mtree</em>, and ensure the necessary directory
     structure is present.</p>
<pre>
  $ cd /usr/src/etc/mtree
  $ sudo install -c -o root -g wheel -m 444 4.4BSD.dist /etc/mtree
  $ sudo mtree -qdef /etc/mtree/
</pre>
</li>

<li> Perform the make build
<pre>
  # cd /usr/src &amp;&amp; make build
</pre>
</li>

<li> <a href="upgrade-minifaq.html#1.9">Update <tt>/etc</tt> <tt>/var</tt> and 
     <tt>/dev/MAKEDEV</tt></a> by hand.

</li>
</ol>

<h2>
Upgrading from 2.6
</h2>

<a name="2.6.1"></a>
<h3>
2.6.1: Termcap entries are too long.
</h3>

<p>
There is a new <tt>termcaps.master</tt> file. You will need
to regenerate the <tt>terminfo</tt> and <tt>termcaps</tt> files
with the current version of
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tic&amp;sektion=1">tic(1)</a>.
If you are upgrading via <em>make build</em>, the correct version of
tic(1) will be used and this will be done for you.  If not, you will
get the following error:
</p>

<pre>
    terminfo.src is corrupt! You need to update /usr/bin/tic
</pre>

<p>
In this case, you must either rebuild and install tic(1) (being sure
to use the current version of <tt>libcurses</tt>) or simply build
the version of tic(1) in your source tree.
</p>

<a name="2.6.2"></a>
<h3>
2.6.2: My <em>pn</em> (or <em>mx</em>, <em>al</em>, <em>ax</em>) device is no longer
recognized by the kernel.
</h3>

<p> (Note: <em>pn</em> is used below for simplicity. This should
be taken to read <em>pn</em>, <em>mx</em>, <em>al</em>, or <em>ax</em>
as appropriate)
</p>

<p>
These four drivers were replaced with a unified <em>dc</em> driver.
You must change all occurrences of <em>pn*</em>, <em>mx</em>,
<em>al</em>, or <em>ax</em> in your configuration files. This includes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Updating your kernel configuration file(s). (Hint: start with a
    fresh GENERIC kernel, and modify from there)
</li>
<li>mv'ing <tt>/etc/hostname.pn*</tt>  to <tt>/etc/hostname.dc*</tt>
</li>
<li>Updating your <tt>/etc/ifaliases</tt> file.
</li>
<li>Changing your <tt>/etc/ipnat.rules</tt> and <tt>/etc/ipf.rules</tt> to
    reflect the new interface name.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you are modifying a custom kernel, make sure you have
included the <em>dcphy</em> device in your kernel config, as follows:
</p>

<pre>
dcphy*  at mii? phy ?                           # Digital Clone PHYs
</pre>

<p>While you are at it, you may also want to add:</p>

<pre>
ukphy*  at mii? phy ?                           # "unknown" PHYs
</pre>

<h3>
2.6.3: Upgrading gcc 2.95.1 to 2.95.2
</h3>

<p><em>gcc</em> 2.95.2 was merged into the OpenBSD source tree around
January 19, 2000. In order for <em>gcc</em> to build properly, a more
recent (post 2.6) <em>libiberty</em> is required. To build this library,
do the following:</p>

<pre>
	cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs/libiberty
	make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
	make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper obj
	make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper
	make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install
</pre>

<p>
NOTE: On mips-based architectures, such as pmax, you must
perform an explicit <em>ldconfig</em> after new libraries are build.
</p>

<p>Once <em>libiberty</em> is build, you may proceed with a standard
<em>gcc</em> bootstrap:</p>

<pre>
   cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs/gcc
   make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
   make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper obj
   make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper -DBOOTSTRAP
   make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper -DBOOTSTRAP install
   make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
   make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper 
   make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install
</pre>

<a name="2.6.4"></a>
<h3>
2.6.4: Upgrading Kerberos.
</h3>

<p>
For Kerberos IV to build correctly, you will have to perform the following
steps:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Obtain and build the latest <tt>usr.bin/compile_et</tt>. </p>
<pre>
   # cd /usr/src/usr.bin/compile_et
   # make clean &amp;&amp; make depend &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p> Obtain and build the latest <tt>lib/libcom_err</tt>. </p>
<pre>
   # cd /usr/src/lib/libcom_err
   # make clean &amp;&amp; make depend &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p> Clean out and reinstall the Kerberos header files: </p>
<pre>
  # rm -r /usr/include/kerberosIV/*
  # cd /usr/src/kerberosIV
  # make includes
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p> Now, rebuild the Kerberos library files:</p>
<pre>
   # cd /usr/src/kerberosIV/lib
   # make clean &amp;&amp; make depend &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p> If you are not doing a complete make build, rebuild Kerberos:</p>
<pre>
   # cd /usr/src/kerberosIV
   # make cleandir &amp;&amp; make depend &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>
</li>
<li> Otherwise, simply restart your <em>make build</em>. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
2.6.5: Upgrading M4.
</h3>

<p>
The version of m4 that shipped with OpenBSD 2.6 will get into an infinite
loop while processing the sendmail .mc files into .cf files.  Because
of this you will need to install the new version of m4 <strong>before</strong>
you attempt a <em>make build</em>.  In other words:
</p>

<pre>
    # cd /usr/src/usr.bin/m4
    # make &amp;&amp; make install &amp;&amp; make cleandir
</pre>

<a name="2.6.6"></a>
<h3>
2.6.6: Upgrading Sendmail.
</h3>

<p>
In sendmail 8.10.X, locations (and names) of the sendmail configuration files
have changed.  Everything but the pid file now lives in /etc/mail.
Additionally, several files have changed names.
</p>

<table border="0">
<tr>
  <td><strong>OLD</strong></td>
  <td><strong>NEW</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt>/etc/sendmail.cf</tt></td>
  <td><tt>/etc/mail/sendmail.cf</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt>/etc/sendmail.cw</tt></td>
  <td><tt>/etc/mail/local-host-names</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt>/etc/sendmail.ct</tt></td>
  <td><tt>/etc/mail/trusted-users</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt>/etc/sendmail.oE</tt></td>
  <td><tt>/etc/mail/error-header</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt>/etc/aliases</tt></td>
  <td><tt>/etc/mail/aliases</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt>/usr/share/misc/sendmail.hf</tt></td>
  <td><tt>/etc/mail/helpfile</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
There are a couple of ways to convert from the old sendmail config
to the new, but the first step is always the same.
</p>

<ol>
<li> Update <tt>/etc/rc</tt> so that it looks for
     <tt>/etc/mail/sendmail.cf</tt> instead of <tt>/etc/sendmail.cf</tt>
</li>
<li> <tt>mv /etc/sendmail.cf /etc/mail/sendmail.cf</tt> <br />
     This is the path of least resistance and you won't have to change
     the location of any other files.
</li>
<li> Or, build a new .cf file from your .mc source file.  Note that you
     no longer need to specify the line:
     <pre>include(`../m4/cf.m4')</pre>
     since it will be included for you by make.  Also note that when
     adding machines to class w (via "Cw machinename"), you now need
     to do that in the LOCAL_CONFIG section (see <tt>openbsd-lists.mc</tt>
     for an example).
</li>
</ol>

<h3>
2.5.1: What are the major problems upgrading from 2.5 to 2.6?
</h3>

<h5><em>perl</em> and <em>make</em></h5>
<p>
The latest version of Perl (5.005_03) requires a new version of
<em>make</em> to compile properly. You must rebuild make before
building the new Perl. Do a:
</p>

<pre>
# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/make
# make clean &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<p>
Then go ahead and rebuild the new Perl. You will need to clean out the Perl
<code>obj</code> directory by hand before building.
</p>

<p>
Perl developers should take note of the latest changes. From 
millert@openbsd.org:
</p>

<pre>
The version of perl in the OpenBSD source tree (post 2.5) has been
upgraded to 5.005_03.  The build method has changed somewhat but
most of that should be invisible.  The important changes that affect
people are as follows:

1) Perl lib files have moved from /usr/lib/perl5 to the more correct
/usr/libdata/perl5
2) The default site_perl directories now live in /usr/local.  Ie:
if you install a perl module, it will place itself in
/usr/local/libdata/perl5/site_lib.  This makes it easy to
see what non-stock modules you have.  It also means that we
can have perl modules in the ports system easily.
3) The perl library man pages are now install in /usr/share/man/cat3p
You'll need to update your man.conf based on the src/etc/man.conf
to take advantage of them.  This means you can now do
"man 3p less" and get info on the less pragma but "man less"
will still get you the less pager manpage.

If you have modules or other non-stock perl files the simplest thing
to do is to move /usr/lib/perl5 to /usr/libdata/perl5 and add a link
from /usr/lib/perl5 to /usr/libdata/perl5.  Alternately, you could
just edit the installed Config.pm file and fix up the paths there.

</pre>

<h5>Compiler Change: <em>egcs</em> replaces <em>gcc</em></h5>
<p>
This change is likely the most significant change you will encounter.
For detailed instructions, see section <a href="#2.5.2">2.5.2</a>.
</p>

<h5>Kernel Structure - <em>statfs</em> - changed</h5>
<p>
The <tt>statfs</tt> structure has changed as of May 31. You must
rebuild your kernel before attempting a <em>make build</em>.
See <a href="#2.5.3">2.5.3</a> for details.

<h3>
2.5.2: How do I upgrade <em>gcc</em> to <em>egcs</em>
</h3>

<p>
The safest way will be to upgrade to a recent snapshot, once one is 
available. <strong>Look for a snapshot first!</strong>. Bootstrapping the new 
compiler from the old should be a <em>last resort</em>.
</p>

<p>
First, note that some platforms have not been bootstrapped
successfully yet. To date, the following should work, if you are 
careful:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>i386</strong>
<li><strong>sparc</strong>
<li><strong>m68k</strong>
<li><strong>alpha</strong>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>mips</strong> and <strong>rs6000</strong> have problems.
</p>

<p>
To test whether your platform can be bootstrapped, grab and install
the egcs-snapshot, available from the 
<a href="../ports.html">ports collection</a>. 
If this works, the in-tree version likely will, too.
This is the <em>safest</em> method of proceeding.
</p>

<p>
Now, before going any further, ensure that your copies of
<em>binutils</em>, <em>gas</em>, and <em>ld</em> are up to date.  Note
that there are two copies of <em>gas</em> and <em>ld</em> in the tree.
On <strong>i386</strong> and <strong>sparc</strong>, the binutils
versions are not used.  Check <tt>/usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/gas</tt> and
<tt>/usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/ld</tt> instead.
</p>

<p>
The following instructions referred to the original egcs snapshot 
(egcs-990517). Since that time, a second snapshot (egcs-990608) has gone
into the tree. If you are coming from vanilla 2.5, it is unlikely that
you will be able to build the latest version directly. In this event, you
will have to bootstrap an intermediate version using these instructions.
</p>

<p>
From espie@openbsd.org:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Today, the compiler changes.

Exit gcc 2.8.1, enter egcs... or more precisely, gcc 2.95 prerelease.

This is probably going to be a rough ride, but I can't work out all
the kinks on every architecture by myself.

I'm going to start importing stuff *now*. There will be a second message
to tech@ once things are settled...

Thanks to everyone who helped me sorting stuff out, most especially
niklas, turan, and millert.

Why the switch
--------------
as most of you already know, egcs is now the *official* compiler supported
by the FSF.  The upcoming july release as been re-christened gcc 2.95.

Just looking at the log messages will show you many improvements:
support for newer processors is better, C++ is more accurately matching
the ANSI/ISO standards, Fortran 77 is more closely integrated.
There are also countless bug-fixes and code generation improvements.

Also the development is more open. There is a cvs tree, there are several
mailing-lists available, and we are cooperating closely with the egcs
team. More precisely, I've been feeding patches back to the egcs team
so that OpenBSD configurations are officially supported.
Also, the development team is highly responsive to bug-reports, and problems
get fixed.

There also is a band-wagon phenomenon: everyone is switching to egcs,
which means lots of code to test the compiler on, and that we can benefit
from related projects.

Why now
-------
egcs-1.1 was unfit for some purposes. Specifically, code size on i386
was larger than gcc 2.8.1, which yielded floppy-disks problems. 
At 2.5 freeze, the only code fit to include was a somewhat unstable
snapshot.  In the interest of stability, after much pondering, egcs was
not put into 2.5.

Right now, the egcs project is going through a release cycle which will
yield egcs 1.2.  Judging from their time schedule, there is ample margin
between egcs 1.2 and the next release of OpenBSD.  Also, we want to get
in now, so that we get a chance to report problems on less frequently 
used architectures, and get everything fixed for 1.2.

egcs `feature freeze' is supposed to occur on may 7th, and the current
snapshot 19990502 looks solid.

What works and what doesn't
---------------------------
egcs runs an i386 OpenBSD system without problems.  m68k works as well,
with a few work-arounds linked to obscure bugs that will get fixed.
sparc seems to be running as well.  There is some linker trouble on some 
other arches that needs to be fixed before our next release.

Right now, constructors across dynamic libraries are not quite ready.

egcs now features a stand-alone cpp which is going to be better than
the current hackish solution we use. This means a few interface changes
and possibly weird warnings.

Keeping gcc 2.8.1 ?
-------------------
due to size constraints, as soon as egcs is imported, gcc is going
to move to cvs Attic.  If you don't want to deal with egcs now, you'll
have to be careful through your cvs updates.
Some Makefiles are bound to change: includes, gnu/usr.bin, and gnu/lib.
xlint and cpp.sh are going to change as well.

How to bootstrap the compiler
-----------------------------
the simplest way is probably to trust the various arch maintainers
and download a snapshot.

If you want to do stuff the hard way, you must first remake proper
obj dirs:
cd /usr/src
make obj

If you run i386, gas must be up-to-date.
If you run sparc, ld must be up-to-date.

then build libiberty:
cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs/libiberty
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper depend
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper 
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

then the C compiler:
cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs/gcc
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper depend
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper 
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

rebuild the C compiler with the new version:
cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs/gcc
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper depend
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper 
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

rebuild the includes
cd /usr/src/include
make includes

build all egcs libraries and install them
cd /usr/src/gnu/egcs
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper clean
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper depend
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper 
make -f Makefile.bsd-wrapper install

install the new cpp driver
cd /usr/src/usr.bin/cpp
make install

then you're all set, and a standard make build should work...
</pre>


<p>
[author note: Actually, it doesn't quite work. xlint will fail to build.
The fix is simple though. Simply do a 
<code> make &amp;&amp; make install </code>
in the <code>/usr/src/usr.bin/xlint/xlint</code> directory before 
you attempt a <em>make build</em> and proceed. See <a href="#2.5.2.2">2.5.2.2</a>.]
</p>

<pre>
If it doesn't, you're using an arch that didn't go through make build yet.
The most probably occurrence is an Internal Compiler Error, as known as an
ICE.

First try to see if the ICE will go away with -O1 or -O0. In that case, you
can put a work-around in the Makefile until it's fixed 
(see /usr/src/lib/libm/Makefile for an example of how to put in such
work-arounds for m68k).

Then the error needs to be reported to the egcs-bugs mailing list.

At a minimum, you must run the source through the same compiler invocation,
with an addition of -v -save-temps to the options.

-v yields the precise sequence of commands invoked by gcc. -save-temps
will give you a pre-processed C file (.i) or C++ (.ii) that the egcs people
can make sense of... you can't ask them to run OpenBSD on their boxes.

If you have more time, you can try to trim down the pre-processed C file to
the bare minimum that triggers the bug. Dichotomy works nicely.

If you made it through this procedure, and everything is still working,
congratulations. If not, check the following sections for advice. Problems

<h5>
2.5.2.1 - <tt>i386</tt> and <tt>sparc</tt> are no longer 
<tt>#define</tt>'ed
</h5>

<p>
This is true. <em>egcs</em> uses the cleaner <tt>__i386__</tt> and
<tt>__sparc__</tt>. If you need to compile code that relies on the old
defines, add a <tt>-Dsparc</tt> or <tt>-Di386</tt> 
to the appropriate location of your Makefile.

<h5>
2.5.2.2 - Build fails in xlint
</h5>

<p>
This is due to semantic differences in cpp. The workaround is simple,
and similar to the <em>cap_mkdb</em> issue described in <a href="#2.4.2">2.4.2</a>.
</p>

<p>
Do a:
</p>

<pre>
# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/xlint/xlint
# make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<p>
now re-run make, and the build should continue.

<h5>
2.5.2.3 - Core Dump on <tt>uthread_autoinit.c</tt>
</h5>

<p>
You have fallen victim to a linker bug. Here's a relevant message:
</p>

<pre>
From: Marc Espie &lt;Marc.Espie@liafa.jussieu.fr&gt;
Subject: egcs core-dumping on uthread_autoinit.c

If this happens to you, this is a known linker problem... the cc1 you have
was linked in a weird way.

Initially, I made cc1 link against static /usr/lib/libiberty.a to avoid this
problem, but this was cutting things too close, and the bug reappeared,
probably thanks to unrelated changes in libc or elsewhere...

The tree has been patched with a work-around in

src/gnu/egcs/f/lang-options.h

make sure you have the kludged version of that file (at least rev 1.2),
recompile and reinstall cc1, the problem should go away.

What's going on is that the 386 linker gets something wrong because of
the huge strings array in toplev.c, and something gets mislinked, so
that
void f(void) __attribute((constructor)) {}
kills cc1.

As a work-around, I've killed Fortran options help texts, until someone finds
where the linker errs.

<h5>
2.5.2.4 - <em>egcs</em> seems much slower than <em>gcc</em>
</h5>

<p>
It is, but there is a reason. <em>egcs</em> performs more optimizing passes.
Data alignment and other such functionality will be better with 
<em>egcs</em>-generated code.
</p>

<a name="2.5.2.5"></a>
<h5>
2.5.2.5 - <em>egcs</em> generates larger code than <em>gcc</em>
</h5>

<p>
Yes it does. This is especially noticeable with the old <tt>-O2</tt>
gcc switch.  <em>egcs</em> introduces a new option, <tt>-Os</tt> which
optimizes for space.  This is roughly comparable to the old
<tt>-O2</tt> behavior.
</p>

<a name="2.5.2.6"></a>
<h5>
2.5.2.6 - After installing <em>egcs</em> I have very little disk space left
</h5>

<p>
<em>egcs</em> installs into a different subdirectory than gcc 2.8.1. You
may remove <em>gcc</em> once egcs is bootstrapped and working.
</p>

<p>
On a related note, the perl changes mentioned in <a href="#2.5.1">2.5.1</a>
mean that you can remove the <tt>/usr/lib/perl5</tt> directory. The
new location for this data is <tt>/usr/libdata/perl5</tt>.
</p>

<h5>
2.5.2.7 - My build dies while making libcurses
</h5>

<p>
<em>libcurses</em> now relies on the latest version of <em>cpp</em>.
Fetch the latest version, rebuild <em>cpp</em>, and continue. Eg:
</p>
<pre>
# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/cpp &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<p>And try the make build again.</p>

<a name="2.5.2.8"></a>
<h5>
2.5.2.8 - make obj fails
</h5>

<p>
If your <em>make obj</em> fails, citing errors in a Makefile, your
makefile includes are likely out of date. For example:
</p>

<pre>
===&gt; lib/libkvm
"Makefile", line 30: Malformed conditional ((${UVM} == "yes"))
"Makefile", line 30: Missing dependency operator
"Makefile", line 32: if-less endif
"Makefile", line 32: Need an operator
Fatal errors encountered -- cannot continue

</pre>

<p>
This can be solved by rebuilding the makefile includes. Do a:
</p>

<pre>
cd /usr/src/share/mk &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<p>
and try the build again.
</p>

<h3>
2.5.3: My <em>make build</em> dies with <em>unimplemented syscall</em> errors.
</h3>

<p><strong>Short Answer:</strong> </p>

<p>
The kernel structure <tt>statfs</tt> has changed. You will need to recompile
the kernel before attempting a <em>make build</em>.
</p>

<p><strong>Long Answer:</strong> </p>

<p>
The kernel structure <tt>statfs</tt> has changed. 
The new <tt>struct statfs</tt> has the following features:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Has a <tt>u_int32_t</tt> flags field--now softdep can have a real flag.
</li>

<li> Uses <tt>u_int32_t</tt> instead of longs (nicer on the alpha).  
Note: the man page used to lie about setting invalid/unused fields to -1.  
SunOS does that but our code never has.
</li>

<li> Gets rid of <tt>f_type</tt> completely.  It hasn't been used since NetBSD 
0.9, and having it there but always 0 is confusing.  It is conceivable
that this may cause some old code to not compile, but that is better
than silently breaking.
</li>

<li> Adds a <tt>mount_info</tt> union that contains the <tt>FSTYPE_args</tt>
struct.  This means that <em>mount</em> can now tell you all the options a 
filesystem was mounted with.  This is especially nice for NFS.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Other changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li> The linux statfs emulation didn't convert between BSD fs names
and linux <tt>f_type</tt> numbers.  Now it does, since the BSD <tt>f_type</tt>
number is useless to linux apps (and has been removed anyway)
</li>

<li> FreeBSD's struct statfs is different from ours (both old and new)
and thus needs conversion.  Previously, the OpenBSD syscalls
were used without any real translation.
</li>

<li> <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mount&amp;sektion=8">mount(8)</a>
will now show extra info when invoked with no arguments.
However, to see <em>everything</em> you need to use the -v (verbose) flag. 
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
2.5.4: Link to the new 2.6 directory.
</h3>

<p>
When upgrading to 2.6 you'll need to create one simple link for gcc.
</p>

<pre>
   cd /usr/lib/gcc-lib
   ln -s ${ARCH}-unknown-openbsd2.5 ${ARCH}-unknown-openbsd2.6
</pre>

<h3>
2.5.5: After an <strong>(U)</strong>pgrade, extraction of <em>base26.tar.gz</em>

</h3>

<p>
<em>tar: Unable to remove directory ./usr/include/machine &lt;Directory

</em>
</p>

<p>In 2.5, <tt>/usr/include/machine</tt> was a directory, and
<tt>/usr/include/i386</tt> was a link to it. In 2.6, this situation
is reversed.

<h2>Upgrading from 2.4</h2>

<a name="2.4.1"></a>
<h3>2.4.1: Man page changes</h3>
<p>
Several man pages were moved from section 1 to later sections.
Unfortunately, if the old man pages are left in section 1, unwary
users will not see the latest version of the page.
</p>

<p>
The following pages should be removed:
</p>
<pre>
/usr/share/man/cat1/ipf.0
/usr/share/man/cat1/ipnat.0
/usr/share/man/cat1/ipsecadm.0

<h3>2.4.2: <em>cap_mkdb</em> syntax changed</h3>

<p>
<strong>Symptom:</strong>
</p>

<p>
A <em>make build</em> resulted in an error like this:
</p>

<pre>
cap_mkdb -i -f terminfo terminfo.src
cap_mkdb: illegal option -- i
usage: cap_mkdb [-v] [-f outfile] file1 [file2 ...]
*** Error code 1
</pre>

<p>
<strong>Fix:</strong>
</p>

<p>
The syntax for invoking <em>cap_mkdb</em> has changed slightly.
Before doing a <em>make build</em>, rebuild cap_mkdb from the latest
sources:
</p>

<pre>
# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/cap_mkdb
# make clean &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>

<p>
The make build should then run to completion

<h3>
2.3.1: New User: <em>named</em>
</h3>

<p>
After 2.3, the <em>named</em> DNS daemon was moved to a chroot jail.
To make this change possible, the <em>named</em> user was created.
If you do not have it already, you will need to create this user to
ensure that all directories get created properly during the build process.
</p>

<p>
Add the following entry to /etc/passwd using <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vipw&amp;sektion=8">vipw(8)</a>:

<a name="2.3.2"></a>
<h3>
2.3.2: I tried the build, but it failed when trying to compile
<em>ssleay</em>.
</h3>

<p>
You are likely missing an entry for the <em>named</em> user in your
password file.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Short Answer:</strong>
</p>

<p>
Create this user prior to the build.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Long Answer:</strong>
</p>

<p>
The <em>named</em> user is required in order to set permissions
correctly.  If this user is missing, part of the build process fails.
If you capture your build to a file (say, with a <em>make build
&amp;&gt;/tmp/build.log</em>) you will notice the following message:
</p>

<pre>
(cd /usr/src/etc &amp;&amp; make DESTDIR=/ distrib-dirs)
install -d -o root -g wheel -m 755 /
mtree -def mtree/4.4BSD.dist -p // -u

mtree: unknown user named
mtree: failed at line 1632 of the specification
*** Error code 1 (ignored)
</pre>

<p>
Unfortunately for us, the build continued happily on its way,
totally ignoring the fact that an error occurred.
</p>

<p>
If the <em>named</em> user exists, mtree works properly:
</p>

<pre>
missing: ./var/named (created)
missing: ./var/named/dev (created)
missing: ./var/named/etc (created)
missing: ./etc/afs (created)
missing: ./etc/ssl (created)
missing: ./etc/ssl/private (created)
missing: ./usr/obj (not created: File exists)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/html (created)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/html/lynx_help (created)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/html/lynx_help/keystrokes (created)
missing: ./usr/share/doc/usd/13.viref (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/cat4/powerpc (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/man4/alpha (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/man4/pmax (created)
missing: ./usr/share/man/man4/powerpc (created)
missing: ./usr/share/tmac/mdoc (created)
missing: ./var/www/htdocs/manual/vhosts (created)
missing: ./usr/include/ssl (created)
</pre>

<p>
The reason for the fail, then, is that the <em>/usr/include/ssl</em>
directory was never created. Without the header files, the
<em>ssleay</em> build fails.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Fix:</strong>
</p>

<p>
Create the <em>named</em> user and group. Remove <em>/usr/include/ssl</em>,
<em>/var/named</em>, and any other directory from the list above that was
mistakenly created as a normal file by the <em>make build</em>.
</p>

<h3>
2.3.3: I tried the build, but it failed when trying to make something for the

<p>
Your directory tree is incomplete. Specifically, the

</p>

<p>
<strong>Quick Fix:</strong>
</p>

<p>
Create this directory and proceed with the compilation

<p>
Create the entire directory tree. Do a:
