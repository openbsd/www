<h2>4.1 - Overview of the OpenBSD installation procedure</h2>

<p>
OpenBSD has a very robust and adaptable  text-based install procedure.
In addition to its robustness, the install procedure can be done using 1
floppy disk. Most architectures have a similar installation procedure;
however there are some differences in details.  In all cases, you are
urged to read the platform-specific INSTALL document in the platform
directory on the CDROM or FTP sites (for example, <tt>INSTALL.i386</tt>,
<tt>INSTALL.mac68k</tt> or <tt>INSTALL.sparc</tt>).

<p>
On most architectures, you have several installation options, including
FTP, CDROM, and local disk files.  One option <b>not</b> supported is 
<a href="faq3.html#ISO">downloading an ISO image</a> to make your own
official CDROM.  CDROMs are available for 
<a href="../orders.html">purchase</a>, however.
Many platforms now have a bootable CD-ROM image (<tt>cd33.iso</tt>)
allowing creation of a bootable CD-ROM for systems which do not support
booting from floppy drives.  This is strictly a boot media, however,
install files must still be retrieved via FTP or other source.

<h3>4.1.2 - Supported Installation Media</h3>

<p>
OpenBSD can be installed from multiple media types. The most
common and architecture independent options are laid out below. These
options can be used after booting from an OpenBSD CD-ROM, floppy
disk or <a href="#bsd.rd">ramdisk kernel</a>.

<h3>4.1.3 - Creating bootable OpenBSD install media.</h3>

<p>
To create an installation floppy image you must either download the
correct boot floppy image from one of the OpenBSD distribution sites or
copy the image from an Official OpenBSD CD-ROM.
You can find a list of FTP servers at the <a href="../ftp.html">OpenBSD
FTP Distribution</a> page.  Most architectures have one or more boot
floppy images to choose from; different images are for different
hardware variations.  The differences between the i386 platform
installation floppies will be outlined below. For the other
architectures with multiple boot floppies, see the INSTALL document in
the respective FTP directory.  For those with only one, just download
the respective <tt>floppy33.fs</tt> image.

<p>
The <a href="../i386.html">i386</a> platform has five separate
installation disk images to choose from:

<ul>
<li><b><tt>floppy33.fs</tt></b> (Desktop PC) supports many
	PCI and ISA NICs, IDE and simple SCSI adapters and some PCMCIA
	support.
<li><b><tt>floppyB33.fs</tt></b> (Servers) supports many RAID controllers,
        and some of the less common SCSI adapters.  However,
	support for many standard SCSI adapters and many EISA and ISA 
	NICS has been removed.
<li><b><tt>floppyC33.fs</tt></b> (Laptops) supports the Cardbus and PCMCIA
        devices found in many laptops.  
<li><b><tt>cdrom33.fs</tt></b> is, in effect a combination of 
	all three boot disks. It can be used to make a bootable 2.88M
	floppy, or more commonly,  as a boot image for a custom 
        recordable CD. 
<li><b><tt>cd33.iso</tt></b> is an ISO9660 image that can be used to
        create a bootable CD with most popular CDR creation software
        on most platforms.  This is <tt>cdrom33.fs</tt> in a "ready to
        record" format.
</ul>

<p>
Most i386 users will just use the <tt>floppy33.fs</tt> installation
floppy.

<p>
Yes, there may be situations where one install disk is required
to support your SCSI adapter and another disk is required to support
your network adapter.  Fortunately, this is a rare event, and can
usually be worked around.

<p>
Once you have the correct floppy image, you need to get a clean floppy
disk.  If there are ANY bad sectors on the floppy disk, the installation
will most likely fail.

<p>
<a name="UnixFlop"></a>
<h4>4.1.3.1 - Creating floppies on Unix.</h4>
To create a formatted floppy, use the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdformat&amp;sektion=1&amp;arch=i386">fdformat(1)</a>
command to both format and check for bad sectors.

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"> <tr> <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  # <b>fdformat /dev/rfd0c</b>
  Format 1440K floppy `/dev/rfd0c'? (y/n): y
  Processing VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV done.
</pre></td></tr> </table>

<p>
If your output is like the above example, then your disk is OK. However,
if you do not see ALL &quot;V&quot;'s then your disk is most likely bad,
and you should try a new one.

<p>
Once you have a clean, formatted floppy it is time to write the
installation image to floppy. For this, you can use the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&amp;sektion=0">dd(1)</a>
utility.  An example usage of <tt>dd(1)</tt> is below:

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"> <tr> <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  # <b>dd if=floppy33.fs of=/dev/rfd0c bs=32k</b>
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
Once the image is written, check to make sure that the copied image is
the same as the original with the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cmp&amp;sektion=1">cmp(1)</a>
command. If the diskette is identical to the image,
you will just see another prompt.

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  # <b>cmp /dev/rfd0c floppy33.fs</b>
</pre></td> </tr> </table>

<a name="DosFlop"></a>
<h4>4.1.3.2 - Creating floppies on DOS/Windows.</h4>
If you are creating this image on the Windows/DOS platform you
can get tools mentioned below from the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/3.3/tools/">tools</a>
directory on any of the ftp mirrors, or in <tt>3.3/tools</tt> directory on
CD1 of the OpenBSD CD set.  For users of DOS/Windows 9x, <i>rawrite</i>
can be used to write your boot floppy.

<p>
To prepare a floppy in MS-DOS or Windows, simply use the native
formatting tools. 

<p>
To write the installation image to the prepared floppy you can use
<i>rawrite</i>, <i>fdimage</i>, or <i>ntrw</i>. <i>rawrite</i> will not
work on Windows NT, 2000 or XP.

<p>
Note that <tt>FDIMAGE.EXE</tt> and <tt>RAWRITE.EXE</tt> are both 
MS-DOS applications, and thus, are limited to MS-DOS's "8.3" file naming
convention.  As <tt>floppy33B.fs</tt> and <tt>floppy33C.fs</tt> have
longer file names, you will have to find out how your system stored
the file in "8.3 format" before using <tt>FDIMAGE.EXE</tt> or 
<tt>RAWRITE.EXE</tt> to make your boot floppies.

<p>
Example usage of <i>rawrite</i>:
<table border=0 width="650"> <tr> <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  C:\> <b>rawrite</b>
  RaWrite 1.2 - Write disk file to raw floppy diskette

<h3>4.1.4 - Booting OpenBSD Installation Images.</h3>

<p>
This section is initially broken down into architecture dependent
sections for popular architectures that OpenBSD supports. This is
so we can properly instruct each user on what to do on their
respective platform.

<h4>Booting i386</h4>

<p>
Booting an install image on the i386 architecture is nothing new to most
people. If you are using the floppy disk, simply stick the floppy into
your floppy drive and boot your system. Your install image will
automatically load (assuming floppy boot is enabled in your BIOS).  
If you are planning on booting from CD, you must go
into your systems BIOS and set the boot options to allow booting from
CD. Some older BIOSs do not have this option, and you must use a floppy
for booting your installation image. Don't worry though; even if you
boot from floppy you can still install from the CD.

<h4>Booting sparc</h4>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> On the sparc64, only the SBus machines (Ultra 1, Ultra 2)
are bootable from floppy.

<p>
To boot from floppy, place your floppy disk with the OpenBSD
installation image on it into your floppy drive. Then use the following
command to boot from your floppy:

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  ok <b>boot floppy</b>
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
To boot from CD-ROM, place your OpenBSD CD-ROM disk into your drive.
If your Sun only has one CD-ROM drive, then just go to the boot prompt,
where you can '<tt>boot cdrom</tt>':

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  ok <b>boot cdrom</b>
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
Of course, this will only work in new command mode.  If you are at the
old command mode prompt (a right arrow), type 'n' for the new command
mode.  (If you are using an old sparc that is pre-sun4c, you probably
don't have a new command mode.  In this case, you need to experiment.)
If you have multiple CD-ROM devices, you need to boot from the correct
one.  Try <tt>probe-scsi</tt> from the new command mode.

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  ok <b>probe-scsi</b>

  Target 0
    Unit 0   Disk     QUANTUM LIGHTNING 365S
  Target 1
    Unit 0   Removable Disk     QUANTUM EMPIRE_1080S
  Target 3
    Unit 0   Removable Disk     Joe's CD ROMs
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
Figure out which disk is the CD ROM you want to boot from.  Note the
target number.

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  ok <b>boot /sbus/esp/sd@X,0</b>
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>

<a name="Checklist"></a>
<h2>4.2 - Preinstallation Checklist</h2>
Before you start your install, you should have some idea what you
want to end up with.

You will want to know the following items, at least:
<ul>
<li>Machine Name
<li>Hardware installed and available
  <ul>
  <li>Verify compatibility with your platform's hardware
      compatibility page
  <li>If ISA, you also need to know hardware settings, and confirm
      they are as OpenBSD requires.
  </ul>
<li>Install method to be used (CDROM, FTP, etc.)
<li>Desired disk layout
  <ul>
  <li>Does existing data need to be saved elsewhere?
  <li>Will OpenBSD co-exist on this system with another OS?  If so, 
      how both will be booted?  Will you need to install
      a "boot manager"?
  <li>Will the entire disk be used for OpenBSD, or will an existing
      (or future) partition have to be worked around?
  <li>How do you wish to sub-partition the OpenBSD part of your 
      disk?
  </ul>
<li>Network settings, if not using DHCP:
  <ul>
  <li>Domain Name
  <li>Domain Name Server(s) (DNS servers)
  <li>IP addresses and subnet masks for each NIC
  <li>Gateway address
  </ul>
<li>Will you be running X on this system?
</ul>



<a name="Install"></a>
<h2>4.3 - Starting the Install</h2>
<!-- XXXrelease -->
Whatever your means of booting is, it is now time to use it.  During 
the boot process, the kernel and all of the programs used to install
OpenBSD are loaded into memory.  The most common problem
when booting is a bad floppy disk or a drive alignment problem.  The
boot floppy is quite tightly packed -- any bad spot will cause problems.

<p>
At almost any point during the OpenBSD install process, you can
terminate the current install attempt by hitting CTRL-C and can restart
it without rebooting by running <tt>install</tt> at the shell prompt.

<p>
When your boot is successful, you will see a lot of text messages scroll by.
This text, on many architectures in white on blue, is the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8">dmesg</a>, 
the kernel telling you what devices have been found,
and where. Don't worry about remembering this text, as a copy is saved as
<tt>/var/run/dmesg.boot</tt>. On some architectures, SHIFT+PGUP will
let you examine text that has scrolled off the screen.

<p>
Then, you will see the following:

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  rootdev=0x1100 rrootdev=0x2f00 rawdev=0x2f02
  erase ^?, werase ^W, kill ^U, intr ^C, status ^T
  (I)nstall, (U)pgrade or (S)hell? <b>i</b>
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
And with that, we reach our first question.  Most of the time, you have
the three options shown:
<ul>
<li><b>Install:</b> load OpenBSD onto the system, overwriting whatever
may have been there.  Note that it is possible to leave some partitions
untouched in this process, such as a <tt>/home</tt>, but otherwise, 
assume everything else is overwritten.
<li><b>Upgrade:</b> Install a new set of <a href="#FilesNeeded">install
files</a> on this machine, but do not overwrite any configuration
information, user data, or additional programs.  No disk formatting is
done, nor are the /etc or /var directories overwritten.  You will
not be given the option of installing the <tt>etc33.tgz</tt> file.
After the install, you will have to manually merge the changes of 
<tt>etc33.tgz</tt> into your system before you can expect it to be 
fully functional.  This is an important step which must be done, as
otherwise certain key services (such as 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf&amp;sektion=4">pf(4)</a>)
may not start.
<br>
<b>NOTE:</b> The Upgrade process is not designed to skip releases! While
this will often work, it is not supported. For OpenBSD 3.3, upgrading
3.2 to 3.3 is the only supported upgrade.  If you have to upgrade from
an older version, a complete reinstall is recommended.

<li><b>Shell:</b> Sometimes, you need to perform repairs or maintenance
to a system which will not (or should not) boot to a normal kernel.  
This option will allow you to do maintenance to the system.
</ul>

On occasion, you will not see the "Upgrade" option listed.  After a
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/flag-day.html">flag
day</a> event, it is not possible to directly upgrade; one must rebuild
the system from scratch.  An example of this was the OpenBSD/sparc
platform, which switched executable formats from a.out to ELF between
3.1 and 3.2, so a user
upgrading to 3.2 or 3.3 on their SPARC must completely reload their system.

<p>
In this example, we will do an install, but the upgrade process is similar.

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  Welcome to the OpenBSD/i386 3.3 install program.

  This program will help you install OpenBSD in a simple and rational way. At
  any prompt except password prompts you can run a shell command by typing
  '!foo', or escape to a shell by typing '!'. Default answers are shown in []'s
  and are selected by pressing RETURN. At any time you can exit this program by
  pressing Control-C and then RETURN, but quitting during an install can leave
  your system in an inconsistent state.

  Specify terminal type: [vt220]
  Do you wish to select a keyboard encoding table? [n] <b>y</b>
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
In most cases, the default terminal type is appropriate; however if you
are using a <a href="faq7.html#SerCon">serial console</a> for install,
don't just take the default,
respond appropriately.

<p>
If you do not select a keyboard encoding table, a US keyboard layout
will be assumed.

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  IS YOUR DATA BACKED UP? As with anything that modifies disk contents, this
  program can cause SIGNIFICANT data loss.

  It is often helpful to have the installation notes handy. For complex disk
  configurations, relevant disk hardware manuals and a calculator are useful.

  Proceed with install? [n] <b>y</b>
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
If you take the default here, the install process will terminate and
drop you to a shell prompt.

<a name="Disks"></a>
<h3>4.3.1 - Setting up disks during installation.</h3>

<p>
Setting up disks in OpenBSD varies a bit between platforms. For
<a href="../i386.html">i386</a> and <a href="../macppc.html">macppc</a>,
disk setup is done in two stages.  First, the OpenBSD slice of the hard
disk is defined using fdisk(8), then that slice is subdivided into
OpenBSD partitions using disklabel(8).

<p>
Some users may be a little confused by the terminology used here. It
will appear we are using the word "partition" in two different ways.
This observation is correct. There are two layers of partitioning in
several OpenBSD platforms, the first, one could consider the Operating
System partitioning, which is how multiple OSs on one computer mark out
their own space on the disk, and the second one is how the OpenBSD
partition is sub-partitioned into individual filesystems.  The first
layer is visible as a disk partition to DOS, Windows, and any other OS
that can coexist with other Operating Systems on the IBM AT descended
machines.  The second layer of partitioning is visible only to OpenBSD
and those OSs which can directly read an OpenBSD filesystem.

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  Cool!  Let's get to it...

  You will now initialize the disk(s) that OpenBSD will use. To enable all
  available security features you should configure the disk(s) to allow the
  creation of separate filesystems for /, /tmp, /var, /usr, and /home.

  Available disks are: wd0.
  Which one is the root disk? (or done) [wd0] <b><i>Enter</i></b>
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
The root disk is the disk the system will boot from, and normally where
swap space resides.  Usually, this will be the default -- if it isn't, you
will need to know how to force your computer to boot from a non-standard
disk.  IDE disks will show up as <tt>wd0</tt>, <tt>wd1</tt>, etc., SCSI disks and
RAID devices will show up as <tt>sd0</tt>, <tt>sd1</tt>, and so on.  All the
disks OpenBSD can find are listed here -- if you have drives which are
not showing up, you have unsupported or improperly configured hardware.

<p>
If you say "yes" to this question, the entire disk will be allocated to
OpenBSD.  This will result in a simple Master Boot Record and partition
table being written out to disk -- one partition, the size of the entire
hard disk, set to the OpenBSD partition type, and flagged as the
bootable partition.  This will be a common option for most production
uses of OpenBSD; however, there are some systems this should not be done
on.  Many Compaq systems, some Dell and other systems use a
"maintenance" partition, which should be kept intact.  If your system
has any other partitions of any type you do not wish to erase, do not
select "yes" to the above question.

<p>
For the sake of this example, we will assume the disk is to be split
between OpenBSD and a pre-existing Windows 2000 partition, so we
take the default of "no", which will take us into the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">fdisk(8)</a>
program.  You can also get more information on fdisk(8)
<a href="faq14.html#fdisk">here</a>.

<p>
<b>Important Note:</b>
Users with a large hard disk (larger than 8G on a newer i386, though on
older machines and different platforms, often much smaller) will want to
see <a href="faq14.html#LargeDrive">this section</a> before going any
further.

  You will now create a single MBR partition to contain your OpenBSD data. This
  partition must have an id of 'A6'; must *NOT* overlap other partitions; and
  must be marked as the only active partition.

A few commands are worthy of elaboration:
<ul>
<li><b><tt>r</tt></b> or <b><tt>reinit</tt>:</b> Clears existing
partition table, makes one big OpenBSD partition, flags it active.
Equivalent to saying "yes" to the "<tt>use *all* of ...</tt>" question.
<li><b><tt>p</tt></b> or <b><tt>print:</tt></b> Displays the current
partition table in sectors.  "<tt>p m</tt>" will show the partition
table in megabytes, "<tt>p g</tt>" will show it in gigabytes.
<li><b><tt>e</tt></b> or <b><tt>edit:</tt></b> edit or alter a table
entry.
<li><b><tt>f</tt></b> or <b><tt>flag:</tt></b> Marks a partition as the
active partition, the one that will be booted from
<li><b><tt>exit</tt></b> and <b><tt>quit:</tt></b> Careful on these, as
some users are used to "exit" and "quit" having opposite meanings.
</ul>

It is worth pointing out once again, a screwup here will result in
significant data loss.  If you are going to do this on a drive with
important data, it might be worth practicing on a "disposable" drive, in
addition to having a good backup.

<p>
Our drive here has a 1.5G partition for Windows 2000 (using the FAT 
filesystem).  Looking at the info from the above display, we can see 
that the Windows partition occupies through cylinder 202 on the drive.
So, we are going to allocate the rest of the disk to OpenBSD, starting
at cylinder 203.  You could also calculate OpenBSD's starting sector of
3069360 by adding the existing partition's starting sector (63) and its
size (3069297).

<p>
You can edit the drive layout in either Cylinder/Heads/Sectors
form or just raw sectors.  Which is easier depends upon what you 
are doing; in this case, working around an existing partition, using
CHS format will probably be easier.

  You will now create an OpenBSD disklabel inside the OpenBSD MBR
  partition. The disklabel defines how OpenBSD splits up the MBR partition
  into OpenBSD partitions in which filesystems and swap space are created.

  The offsets used in the disklabel are ABSOLUTE, i.e. relative to the
  start of the disk, NOT the start of the OpenBSD MBR partition.

  disklabel: no disk label
  WARNING: Disk wd0 has no label. You will be creating a new one.

  Treating sectors 3069360-39100320 as the OpenBSD portion of the disk.
  You can use the 'b' command to change this.

          Non-sector units will be rounded to the nearest cylinder.
  Entering '?' at most prompts will give you (simple) context sensitive help.

</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
Again, a few of these commands could use a little elaboration:
<ul>
<li><b><tt>p</tt></b> - displays (prints) the current disklabel to the
screen, and you can use the modifiers <tt>k, m</tt> or <tt>g</tt> for
kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes.

<li><b><tt>D</tt></b> - Clears any existing disklabel, creates a new
default disklabel which covers just the current OpenBSD partition.  This
can be useful if the disk previously had a disklabel on it, and the
OpenBSD partition was recreated to a different size -- the old disk
label may not get deleted, and may cause confusion.

<li><b><tt>m</tt></b> - Modifies an existing entry in a disklabel.
Do not over estimate what this will do for you. While it may alter the
size of a disklabel partition, it will NOT alter the filesystem on the
drive.  Using this option and expecting it to resize existing partitions
is a good way of losing large amounts of data.

</ul>

<p>
Slicing up your disk properly is important.  The answer to the question,
"How should I partition my system?" is "Exactly how you need it".  This
will vary from application to application.  There is no universal
answer.  If you are unsure of how you want to partition your system, see
<a href="#SpaceNeeded">this discussion</a>.

<p>
In this system, we have over 17G available for OpenBSD.  That's a lot 
of space, and it isn't likely we will need most of it.  So, we will 
deliberately not use absolute minimum sizes.  We would rather have a 
few hundred megabytes of unused space than a kilobyte too little.  

<p>
On the root disk, the two partitions 'a' and 'b' <b>must</b> be 
created. The installation process will not proceed until these two
partitions are available. 'a' will be used for the root filesystem (/)
and 'b' will be used as swap space.

<p>
After a little thought, we decide to create just enough partitions to
allow the creation of the recommended separate filesystems (<tt>/, /tmp,
/var, /usr, /home</tt>) along with a swap partition:
<ul>
<li><i><b>wd0a: /</b></i> (root) - 150M.  Should be more than enough.
<li><i><b>wd0b: </b></i>(swap) - 300M.
<li><i><b>wd0d: /tmp</b></i> - 120M.  <tt>/tmp</tt> is used for building
  some software, 120M will probably be enough for most things.
<li><i><b>wd0e: /var</b></i> - 80M.  If this were to be a web or mail
  server, we'd have made this partition much larger, but, that's not
  what we are doing.
<li><i><b>wd0g: /usr</b></i> - 2G.  We want this partition to be large
  enough to load quite a few user applications, plus be able to update
  and rebuild the system if desired or needed.  The 
  <a href="../ports.html">Ports tree</a> will be here as well, which
  will take almost 100M of this space before ports are built.
<li><i><b>wd0h: /home</b></i> - 4G.  This will allow plenty of user file
  space.
</ul>

Now, if you add those up, you will see over 10G of space is unused!
Unused space won't hurt anything, and it gives us flexibility to enlarge
things in the future if need be.  Need more <i>/tmp</i>?  No problem,
create a new one in the unused space, change <i>/etc/fstab</i> and
problem solved.

You will note there is a <i>c</i> partition we seem to have ignored.  This
partition is your entire hard disk; don't attempt to alter it.  You will
also note the <i>i</i> partition wasn't defined by us; this is the
pre-existing Windows 2000 partition. Partitions are not assigned any particular letters -- with the exception
of <i>a</i> (root), <i>b</i> (swap) and <i>c</i> (entire disk), the rest
of the partitions (through letter <i>p</i>) are available for use as you
desire.

<p>
If you look closely at the output of the disklabel, you will note that 
your drive RPM rating is probably wrong.  This is historical; the
drive speed is not used in any way by the system. Do not worry about
it.

<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=disklabel&amp;sektion=8">disklabel(8)</a>, 
this step consists of just verifying
your selections; otherwise, you can specify them now.

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  The root filesystem will be mounted on wd0a.
  wd0b will be used for swap space.
  Mount point for wd0d (size=122976k), none or done? [/tmp] <b><i>Enter</i></b>
  Mount point for wd0e (size=82152k), none or done? [/var] <b><i>Enter</i></b>
  Mount point for wd0g (size=2097144k), none or done? [/usr] <b><i>Enter</i></b>
  Mount point for wd0h (size=4194288k), none or done? [/home] <b><i>Enter</i></b>
  Mount point for wd0d (size=122976k), none or done? [/tmp] <b>done</b>
  Done - no available disks found.
 
  You have configured the following partitions and mount points:

  wd0a /
  wd0d /tmp
  wd0e /var
  wd0g /usr
  wd0h /home

  The next step creates a filesystem on each partition, ERASING existing data.

<p>
You may wonder why the installer again asks for mount points.  This
allows you to recover from any errors or omissions in the mount
points specified during the creation of the disklabel. For instance,
the installation process will automatically delete any duplicate
mount points you enter during the configuration of the disklabel. The
disklabel program will allow you to enter such duplicates, and thus
they must be checked for after the disklabel program exits. The
deleted duplicate mount points will result in partitions without mount
points, that you must assign new mount points for if you wish to use
the space.

<p>
Notice the "Are you really sure that you are ready to proceed?" question
defaults to no, so you will have to deliberately tell it to proceed and
format your partitions. If you chose no, you would simply be dropped
into a shell and could start the install again by typing install, or
just by rebooting again with your boot disk.

<p>
At this point all filesystems will formatted for you.  This could take
some time depending on the size of the partitions and the speed of the
disk.

<a name="Hostname"></a>
<h3>4.3.2 - Setting the System Hostname</h3>
<p>
Now you must set the system hostname. This value will be saved in the
file <tt>/etc/myname</tt>, which is used during normal boots to set the hostname
of the system. As of OpenBSD 3.2 the name stored in <tt>/etc/myname</tt>
includes the fully qualified domain name of the system (FQDN). If you do
not set the FQDN of the system, the default value of 'my.domain' will be
used.

<p>
It is important to set this name now, because it will be used when the
cryptographic keys for the system are generated during the first boot
after installation. This generation takes place whether the network is
configured or not.

<p> 
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  Enter system hostname (short form, e.g. 'foo'): <b>puffy</b>
</pre></td></tr></table>

<a name="Network"></a>
<h3>4.3.3 - Configuring your Network</h3>

<p>
Now it is time to configure your network.  The network must be
configured if you are planning on doing a ftp or nfs based install,
considering it will be based upon the information you are about to
enter. Here is a walk through of the network configuration section of
the install process.

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  Configure the network? [y] <b><i>Enter</i></b>
  Available interfaces are: fxp0.
  Which one do you wish to initialize? (or 'done') [fxp0] <b><i>Enter</i></b>
  Symbolic (host) name for fxp0? [puffy] <b><i>Enter</i></b>
  The default media for fxp0 is
          media: Ethernet autoselect (100baseTX full-duplex)
  Do you want to change the default media? [n] <b><i>Enter</i></b>
  IP address for fxp0? (or 'dhcp') <b>199.185.137.55</b>
  Netmask? [255.255.255.0] <b><i>Enter</i></b>
  Done - no available interfaces found.
  DNS domain name? (e.g. 'bar.com') [my.domain] <b>example.com</b>
  DNS nameserver? (IP address or 'none') [none] <b>199.185.137.1</b>
  Use the nameserver now? [y] <b><i>Enter</i></b>
  Default route? (IP address, 'dhcp' or 'none') <b>199.185.137.128</b>
  add net default: gateway 199.185.137.128
  Edit hosts with ed? [n] <b><i>Enter</i></b> 
  Do you want to do any manual network configuration? [n] <b><i>Enter</i></b>
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
In the above example, we use a static IP address. As indicated, you can
use "<tt>dhcp</tt>" instead on most platforms (not
<a href="../alpha.html">Alpha</a>), assuming your environment supports
it. In the case of DHCP, most of the information will be grabbed from
the remote DHCP server; you will be given a chance to confirm it.
Here is a sample of the network configuration part of the install, this
time done with DHCP:

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  Configure the network? [y] <b><i>Enter</i></b>
  Available interfaces are: fxp0.

  Do you want to do any manual network configuration? [n] <b><i>Enter</i></b>
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
<b>NOTE: </b>Only <b>one</b> interface can easily be configured using
DHCP during an install. If you attempt to configure more than one
interface using DHCP you will encounter errors. You have to manually
configure the additional interfaces after the installation.

<p>
Now, we set the password for the root account:
<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
Password for root account? (will not echo) <b><i>pAssWOrd</i></b>
Password for root account? (again) <b><i>pAssWOrd</i></b>
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
Use a secure password for the root account.  You will create other
user accounts after the system is booted.  From 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=passwd&amp;sektion=1">passwd(1)</a>:
<pre>
    The new password should be at least six characters long and not purely
    alphabetic.  Its total length must be less than _PASSWORD_LEN (currently
    128 characters).  A mixture of both lower and uppercase letters, numbers,
    and meta-characters is encouraged.
</pre>

<a name="InstMedia"></a>
<h3>4.3.4 - Choosing Installation Media</h3>

<p>
After your network is set up, the install script will give you a chance
to make manual adjustments to the configuration. Then the filesystems you
created will be mounted and a root password set. This will get your
local disks ready for the OpenBSD packages to be installed upon them.

<p>
Next, you will get a chance to choose your installation media. The
options are listed below.

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  You will now specify the location and names of the install sets you want to
  load. You will be able to repeat this step until all of your sets have been
  successfully loaded. If you are not sure what sets to install, refer to the
  installation notes for details on the contents of each.
 
  Sets can be located on a (m)ounted filesystem; a (c)drom, (d)isk or (t)ape
  device; or a (f)tp, (n)fs or (h)ttp server.
  Where are the install sets? <b>c</b>
  Available CD-ROMs are: cd0.
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
In this example we are installing from CD-ROM. This will bring up a list
of devices on your computer identified as a CD-ROM. Most people will
only have one. If you need to, make sure you pick the device
which you will use to install OpenBSD from. 

<p>
<b>NOTE: </b>All possible sources for install sets are listed, but not
all may be available on your system. e.g. (n)fs is shown but not all
architectures allow NFS installations. If you choose a source that is
not available, you will get an error message and be given the chance
to choose another source for your installation sets.

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  Available CD-ROMs are: cd0.
  Which one contains the install media? (or 'done') [cd0] <b><i>Enter</i></b>

  Pathname to the sets?  (or 'done') [3.3/i386] <b><i>Enter</i></b>
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
Here, you are prompted for which directory the installation files are, 
which is <tt>3.3/i386/</tt> on the official CDROM.  

<a name="Filesets"></a>
<h3>4.3.5 - Choosing Filesets.</h3>

<p>
Now it's time to choose which packages you will be installing. You can
get a description of these files in <a href="#FilesNeeded">the next
section</a>. The files that the install program finds will be shown to
you on the screen. Your job is just to specify which files you want. By
default all the non-X packages are selected; however, some people may
wish to limit this to the bare minimum required to run OpenBSD, which
would be <tt>base33.tgz</tt>, <tt>etc33.tgz</tt> and <tt>bsd</tt>.
Others will wish to install all packages. The example below is that of a
full install.

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  The following sets are available. Enter a filename, 'all' to select
  all the sets, or 'done'. You may de-select a set by prepending a '-'
  to its name.

          [X] bsd
          [ ] bsd.rd
          [X] base33.tgz
          [X] etc33.tgz
          [X] misc33.tgz
          [X] comp33.tgz
          [X] man33.tgz
          [X] game33.tgz
          [ ] xbase33.tgz
          [ ] xshare33.tgz
          [ ] xfont33.tgz
          [ ] xserv33.tgz

  File Name? (or 'done') [bsd.rd] <b>all</b>

  The following sets are available. Enter a filename, 'all' to select
  all the sets, or 'done'. You may de-select a set by prepending a '-'
  to its name.

          [X] bsd
          [X] bsd.rd
          [X] base33.tgz
          [X] etc33.tgz
          [X] misc33.tgz
          [X] comp33.tgz
          [X] man33.tgz
          [X] game33.tgz
          [X] xbase33.tgz
          [X] xshare33.tgz
          [X] xfont33.tgz
          [X] xserv33.tgz
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
You can do all kinds of nifty things here -- <tt>-x*</tt> would remove
all X components, if you changed your mind.  In this case, we are going
to load all the sets.  While the system will run with fewer sets, the
starting default is recommended.
More details on selecting sets <a href="#FilesNeeded">here</a>.

<p>
Once you have successfully picked which packages you want, you will be
prompted to make sure you want to extract these packages and they will
then be installed. A progress bar will be shown that will keep you
informed on how much time it will take. The times range greatly
depending on what system it is you are installing OpenBSD on, the
packages installed, and the speed of the source media.  This part may
from a few minutes to several hours.

</pre></td></tr></table>

At this point, you can pull additional files from other sources if
desired, or hit '<tt>done</tt>' if you have installed all the file sets
you need.

<p>
If your system has a small amount of RAM (less than 20M on i386), do not 
answer that prompt quite yet!

<a name="SmallRAM"></a>
<h3>4.3.6 - Special steps for machines with little RAM</h3>
As OpenBSD has grown, the minimum RAM requirement has grown, and is
likely to continue to increase.  The next step in the install process
will require more than 16M RAM, and will fail on older machines with
less than 20M RAM (again, these are i386 numbers -- some other platforms
will require far less RAM, though this trick can be used with them as
well, if they are running near the lower-limits).

<p>
During the install process, there is normally no swap; the real RAM is
all you have.  The 'MAKEDEV' step that follows will require more than
the rest of the install required.  As a system with small amounts of RAM
can still be very usable for many applications, working around this
limitation is a quite useful trick.

<p>
The solution is to activate swap now.  The swap partition has been
created, the files are installed to the hard disk, the only trick here
is to manually invoke it.  So, do not just hit '<tt>done</tt>' at the above
prompt, but rather, hit '!', which will bring up a shell, and launch 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=swapon&amp;sektion=8">swapon(8)</a>
from the mounted hard drive:

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  Where are the install sets? (or 'done') <b>!</b>
  Type 'exit' to return to install.
  # <b>/mnt/sbin/swapon /dev/wd0b</b>
  # <b>exit</b>
  Where are the install sets? (or 'done') <b>done</b>
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
You can now resume the normal installation.

<a name="Finish"></a>
<h3>4.3.7 - Finishing up</h3>

You will now be asked if you plan to run X on this system.  If you
answer 'Y', <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt> will be modified to include the
line <tt>machdep.allowaperture=1</tt> or <tt>machdep.allowaperture=2</tt>,
depending on your platform.

<p>
Your last task is to enter the time zone.  Depending on where your
machine lives, there are may be several equally valid answers for the
question.  In the example that follows, we used <tt>US/Eastern</tt>, but
could also have used <tt>EST5EDT</tt> or <tt>US/Michigan</tt> and had
the same result.  Hitting <tt>?</tt> at the prompts will guide you
through your choices.

<h2>4.4 - What files are needed for Installation?</h2>
<!-- XXXrelease -->

<p>
The complete OpenBSD installation is broken up into a number of 
separate <i>file sets</i>.  Not every application requires every
file set.  Here is an overview of each:
<p>
<ul>
  <li><b><i>bsd</i></b>          - This is the Kernel. <b>Required</b>
  <li><b><i>bsd.rd</i></b> - <a href="#bsd.rd">RAM disk kernel</a>
  <li><b><i>base33.tgz</i></b>   - Contains the base OpenBSD system 
    <b>Required</b>
  <li><b><i>etc33.tgz</i></b>    - Contains all the files in /etc 
    <b>Required</b>
  <li><b><i>comp33.tgz</i></b>    - Contains the compiler and its 
    tools, libs. <b>Recommended</b>
  <li><b><i>man33.tgz</i></b>    - Contains man pages <b>Recommended</b>
  <li><b><i>misc33.tgz</i></b>   - Contains misc info, setup documentation
  <li><b><i>game33.tgz</i></b>   - Contains the games for OpenBSD
  <li><b><i>xbase33.tgz</i></b>  - Contains the base install for X11
  <li><b><i>xfont33.tgz</i></b>  - Contains X11's font server and fonts
  <li><b><i>xserv33.tgz</i></b>  - Contains X11's X servers
  <li><b><i>xshare33.tgz</i></b> - Contains manpages, locale settings,
    includes, etc  for X
</ul>

<p>
<a name= "SpaceNeeded"></a>
<h2> 4.5 - How much space do I need for an OpenBSD installation?</h2>
<!-- XXXrelease -->

<p>
The following are minimum suggested filesystem sizes for a full system
install.  The numbers include enough extra space to permit you to run a
typical home system that is connected to the Internet.

<ul>
<li>These are minimum values.  
<li>If you plan to install a significant amount of third party software,
make your <tt>/usr</tt> partition large!  <b>At least</b> triple these
values!
<li>For a system that handles lots of email or web pages (stored,
respectively, in <tt>/var/mail</tt> and <tt>/var/www</tt>) you will want
to make your <tt>/var</tt> partition significantly larger, or put them
on separate partitions.
<li>For a multiuser system which may generate lots of logs, you will
still want to make your <tt>/var</tt> partition significantly larger
(<tt>/var/log</tt>).
<li>If you plan to rebuild the kernel or system from source, you will
want to make the <tt>/usr</tt> partition significantly larger, <b>at
least</b> 800M-1G larger than indicated below.
</ul>

As you read this, keep in mind that <tt>/usr</tt> and
<tt>/usr/X11R6</tt> are usually both parts of the same filesystem, that
is, <tt>/usr</tt>, as there is no big advantage to making them into
separate filesystems.

<blockquote>
<pre>
<b>
SYSTEM          /       /usr    /var    /usr/X11R6
alpha           80M     250M    25M     140M
hp300           80M     250M    25M     140M

vax            100M     200M    25M     120M
</b>
</pre>
</blockquote>

In addition, it is recommended that a <tt>/tmp</tt> partition be used.
The <tt>/tmp</tt> partition is used in the compiling of ports, among
other things, so how big you make it depends on what you do with it.
50M may be plenty for most people, but some large applications may
require 100M or more of <tt>/tmp</tt> space.

<p>
When you are in the disklabel editor, you may choose to make your entire
system have just an 'a' (main filesystem) and 'b' (swap) .  The 'a'
filesystem which you set up in disklabel will become your root
partition, which should be the sum of all the 3 main values above
(<tt>/</tt>, <tt>/usr</tt>, and <tt>/var</tt>) plus some space for
<tt>/tmp</tt>.  The 'b' partition you set up automatically becomes your
system swap partition -- we recommend a minimum of 32MB but if you have
disk to spare make it at least 64MB.  If you have lots of disk space to
spare, make this 256MB, or even 512MB.

<p>
Swap space is used to store system core dumps on in the event of a
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=crash&amp;sektion=8">crash(8)</a>.
If this is a consideration for you, your swap space should be slightly
larger than the amount of main memory you are likely to ever have in the
system.  Note that upon reboot, 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=savecore&amp;sektion=8">savecore(8)</a>
will attempt to save the contents of the swap partition to a file in
<tt>/var/crash</tt> so again, if this is a priority for you, your
<tt>/var</tt> partition must have enough <i>free space</i> to hold these
dump files.

<p>
There are five main reasons for using separate filesystems, instead of
shoving everything into one or two filesystems:

<ul>
<li><b>Security</b>: You can mark some filesystems as 'nosuid', 'nodev', 
  'noexec', 'readonly', etc.  This is now done by the install process,
  in fact, if you use the above described partitions.
<li><b>Stability</b>: A user, or a misbehaved program, can fill a 
  filesystem with garbage if they have write permissions for it.  Your 
  critical programs, which of course run on a different filesystem, do 
  not get interrupted.
<li><b>Speed</b>: A filesystem which gets written to frequently may get
  somewhat fragmented.  (Luckily, the ffs filesystem, what OpenBSD uses,
  is not prone to heavy fragmentation.)
<li><b>Integrity</b>: If one filesystem is corrupted for some reason
  then your other filesystems are still OK.
<li><b>Size</b>: Many platforms have limits on the area of a disk where
  the boot ROM can load the kernel from.  In some cases, this limit may
  be very small (504M for an older 486), in other cases, a much larger
  limit (8G on new i386 systems).  As the kernel can end up anywhere in
  the root partition, the entire root partition should be within this
  area. For more details, see <a href="faq14.html#LargeDrive">this
  section</a>.  A good guideline might be to keep your / partition
  completely below 2G, unless you know your platform (and particular
  machine!) can handle more (or less!) than that.
</ul>

<p>
Some additional thoughts on partitioning:
<ul>
 <li>For your first attempt at an experimentation system, one big
   <tt>/</tt> partition and swap may be easiest until you know how much
   space you need. By doing this you will be sacrificing some of the
   default security features of OpenBSD that require separate
   filesystems for <tt>/, /tmp, /var, /usr</tt> and <tt>/home</tt>.
 <li>A system exposed to the Internet or other hostile forces should
   have a separate <tt>/var</tt> (and maybe even a separate
   <tt>/var/log</tt>) for logging.
 <li>A <tt>/home</tt> partition can be nice.  New version of the OS?
   Wipe and reload everything else, leave your <tt>/home</tt> partition
   untouched.  Remember to save a copy of your configuration files,
   though!
 <li>A separate partition for anything which may accumulate a large
   quantity of files that may need to be deleted can be faster to
   reformat and recreate than to delete.  See the <a
   href="upgrade-minifaq.html#1.5">upgrade-minifaq</a> for an example
   (<tt>/usr/obj</tt>).
 <li>If you wish to rebuild your system from source for any reason,
   the source will be in <tt>/usr/src</tt>.  If you don't make a
   separate partition for <tt>/usr/src</tt>, make sure <tt>/usr</tt> has
   sufficient space.
 <li>A commonly forgotten fact: you do <b>not</b> have to allocate
   all space on a drive when you set the system up! Since  you will now
   find it a challenge to buy a new drive smaller than 20G, it can make
   sense to leave a chunk of your drive unallocated.  If you outgrow a
   partition, you can allocate a new partition from your unused space,
   <a href="faq10.html#DupFS">duplicate</a> your existing partition to
   the new partition, change
   <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fstab&amp;sektion=5">/etc/fstab</a>
   to point to the new partition, remount, you now have more space.
 <li>If you make your partitions too close to the minimum size required,
   you will probably regret it later, when it is time to upgrade your
   system.
 <li>If you permit users to write to <tt>/var/www</tt> (i.e., personal
   web pages), you might wish to put it on a separate partition, so you
   can use <a href="faq10.html#Quotas">quotas</a> to restrict the space
   they use, and if they fill the partition, no other parts of your
   system will be impacted.
</ul>


<p>
<a name= "Multibooting"></a>
<h2>4.6 - Multibooting OpenBSD (i386)</h2>

Multibooting is having several operating systems on one computer, and
some means of selecting the which OS is to boot.  It is <i>not</i> a
trivial task!  If you don't understand what you are doing, you may
end up deleting large amounts of data from your computer.  New OpenBSD
users are <i>highly</i> encouraged to start with a blank hard drive on a
dedicated machine, and then practice your desired configuration on a
non-production system before attempting a multiboot configuration on a
production machine.  <a href="faq14.html">FAQ 14</a> has more
information about the OpenBSD boot process.

<p>
When multibooting, the requirements of all operating systems must be met
by your configuration.  People often ask if there is a way around the
<a href="faq14.html#LargeDrive">8G boot limit</a> of OpenBSD.  While
there are some programs that claim to get around various limits of
various operating systems, none of them are known to do this with
current versions of OpenBSD.

<p>
Here are several options to multibooting:

<h3>Setting active partitions</h3>
This is probably the most overlooked, and yet, sometimes the best
solution for multibooting.  Simply set the active partition in whatever
OS you are currently using to be the one you want to boot by default
when you next boot.  Virtually every OS offers a program to do
this; OpenBSD's is <a href="faq14.html#fdisk">fdisk(8)</a>, similar
named programs are in Windows 9x and DOS, and many other operating
systems.  This can be highly desirable for OSs or systems which take a
long time to shut down and reboot -- you can set it and start the reboot
process, then walk away, grab a cup of coffee, and come back to the system
booted the way you want it -- no waiting for the Magic Moment to select
the next OS.

<h3>Boot floppy</h3>
If you have a system that is used to boot OpenBSD infrequently (or don't
wish other users of the computer to note anything has changed), consider
using a boot floppy.  Simply use one of the <a href="#MkFlop">standard
OpenBSD install floppies</a>, and create a <tt>/etc/boot.conf</tt> file
(yes, you will also have to create an <tt>/etc</tt> directory on the
floppy) with the contents:

<pre>
     boot hd0a:/bsd
</pre>

to cause the system to boot from hard drive 0, OpenBSD partition 'a',
kernel file <tt>/bsd</tt>.  Note you can also boot from other drives
with a line like: "<tt>boot hd2a:/bsd</tt>" to boot off the third
hard drive on your system.  To boot from OpenBSD, slip your floppy in,
reboot.  To boot from the other OS, eject the floppy, reboot.  

<p>
In this case, the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">boot(8)</a>
program is loaded from the floppy, looks for and reads
<tt>/etc/boot.conf</tt>.  The "<tt>boot hd0a:/bsd</tt>" line instructs
boot(8) where to load the kernel from -- in this case, the first HD the
BIOS sees.  Keep in mind, only a small file (<tt>/boot</tt>) is loaded
from the floppy -- the system loads the entire kernel off the hard disk,
so this only adds about five seconds to the boot process.

<h3>Windows NT/2000/XP NTLDR</h3>

To multiboot OpenBSD and Windows NT/2000/XP, you can use NTLDR, the
boot loader that NT uses. To multi-boot with NT,  you need a copy of your
OpenBSD Partition Boot Record (PBR). After running installboot, you can
copy it to a file using 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&amp;sektion=1">dd(1)</a>:

<pre>
	# <strong>dd if=/dev/rsd0a of=openbsd.pbr bs=512 count=1</strong>
</pre>

<p>
Now boot NT and put <tt>openbsd.pbr</tt> in C:. Add a line like this to
the end of <tt>C:\BOOT.INI</tt>:

<pre>
	c:\openbsd.pbr="OpenBSD"
</pre>

<p>
When you reboot, you should be able to select OpenBSD from the NT loader
menu. There is much more information available about NTLDR at the 
<a href="http://www.tburke.net/info/ntldr/ntldr_hacking_guide.htm">NTLDR
Hacking Guide.</a>

<p>
On Windows XP you can also edit the boot information using the GUI; see the
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q289022">XP 
Boot.ini HOWTO</a>.

<p>
Note: The Windows NT boot loader is only capable of booting OSs from the
primary hard drive.  You can not use it to load OpenBSD from the second drive
on a system.

<p>
<h3>Other boot loaders</h3>

<p>
Some other bootloaders OpenBSD users have used successfully include 
<a href="http://gag.sourceforge.net/">GAG</a>,
<a href="http://www.prz.tu-berlin.de/~wolf/os-bs.html">OSBS</a>,
<a href="http://www.ranish.com/part/">The Ranish Partition Manager</a>
and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GRUB</a>. 

<p>
<h3>OpenBSD and Linux (i386)</h3>
<!-- XXXversion -->

<p>
Please refer to 
<a href="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/3.3/i386/INSTALL.linux">INSTALL.linux</a>,
which gives in depth instructions on getting OpenBSD working with Linux.

<a name= "SendDmesg"></a>
<h2>4.7 - Sending your dmesg to dmesg@openbsd.org after the install</h2>

<p>
Just to remind people, it's important for the OpenBSD developers to keep
track of what hardware works, and what hardware doesn't work perfectly.

<p>
A quote from /usr/src/etc/root/root.mail
<pre>
If you wish to ensure that OpenBSD runs better on your machines, please do us
a favor (after you have your mail system configured!) and type
        dmesg | mail dmesg@openbsd.org
so that we can see what kinds of configurations people are running.  We will
use this information to improve device driver support in future releases.
(We would be much happier if this information was for the supplied GENERIC
kernel; not for a custom compiled kernel).  The device driver information
we get from this helps us fix existing drivers.
</pre>

<p>
Make sure you send email from an account that is able to also receive
email so developers can contact you back if they have something they
want you to test or change in order to get your setup working. It's not
important at all to send the email from the same machine that is running
OpenBSD, so if that machine is unable to receive email, just

<pre>
$ dmesg | mail your-account@yourmail.dom
</pre>
and then forward that message to
<pre>
 dmesg@openbsd.org
</pre>
where <tt>your-account@yourmail.dom</tt> is your regular email account.
(or transfer the dmesg output using ftp/scp/floppydisk/carrier-pigeon/...)

<p>
<strong>NOTE</strong> - Please send only GENERIC kernel dmesgs. Custom
kernels that have device drivers removed are not helpful.

<a name="AddFileSet"></a>
<h2>4.8 - Adding a file set after install</h2>
<!-- XXXversion -->
"Oh no!  I forgot to add a file set when I did the install!"
<p>
Sometimes, you realize you really DID need <tt>comp33.tgz</tt> (or any
other system component) after all, but you didn't realize this at the
time you installed your system.  Good news: There are two easy ways to
add file sets after the initial install:

<h3>Using the Upgrade process</h3>
Simply boot your install media (CD-ROM or Floppy), and choose Upgrade
(rather than Install).  When you get to the lists of file sets to
install, choose the sets you neglected to install first time around,
select your source, and let it install them for you.

<h3>Using tar(1)</h3>
The install file sets are simply compressed tar files, and you can
expand them manually from the root of the filesystem:

<p>
<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  # cd /
  # tar xzvpf comp33.tgz
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
Do NOT forget the <tt>'p'</tt> option in the above command in
order to restore the file permissions properly!
<p>
One common mistake is to think you can use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pkg_add&amp;sektion=1">pkg_add(1)</a>
to add a missing file sets.  This does not work.  pkg_add(1) is
for package files, not generic tar files like the install sets.


<a name="bsd.rd"></a>
<h2>4.9 - What is 'bsd.rd'?</h2>

<b><tt>bsd.rd</tt></b> is a "RAM Disk" kernel.  This file can be very 
useful; many developers are careful to keep it on the root of their
system at all times.

<p>
Calling it a "RAM Disk kernel" describes the root filesystem of the
kernel -- rather than being a physical drive, the utilities available
after the boot of <tt>bsd.rd</tt> are stored in the kernel, and are run
from a RAM-based filesystem.  <tt>bsd.rd</tt> also includes a healthy set
of utilities to allow you to do system maintenance and installation.

<p>
On some platforms, <tt>bsd.rd</tt> is actually the preferred 
installation technique -- you place this kernel on an existing 
filesystem, boot it, and run the install from it.  On most 
platforms, if you have a running older version of OpenBSD, you 
can FTP  a new version of <tt>bsd.rd</tt>, reboot from it, and 
install a new version of OpenBSD without using any removable 
media at all.

<p>
Here is an example of booting <tt>bsd.rd</tt> on an i386 system:

<table border=0 width="650"><tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>
  Using Drive: 0 Partition: 3
  reading boot.....
  probing pc0 com0 com1 apm mem[639k 255M a20=on]
  disk fd0 hd0
  &gt;&gt; OpenBSD/i386 BOOT 1.29
  boot&gt; <b>boot hd0a:/bsd.rd</b>
<i>. . . normal boot to install . . .</i>
</pre></td></tr></table>

As indicated, you will be brought to the install program, but you
can also drop to the shell to do maintenance on your system.
<p>
The general rule on booting <tt>bsd.rd</tt> is to change your boot
kernel from <tt>/bsd</tt> to <tt>bsd.rd</tt> through whatever 
means used on your platform.

<a name="InstProb"></a>
<h2>4.10 - Common Installation Problems</h2>

<a name="mkdevhang"></a>
<h3>4.10.1 - Install hangs during MAKEDEV</h3>
Usually, this is caused by a lack of physical RAM in the system.
See <a href="#SmallRAM">here</a>.

<a name="cpq16m"></a>
<h3>4.10.2 - My Compaq only recognizes 16M RAM</h3>
<i>Some</i> Compaq systems have an issue where the full system RAM is
not detected by the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">OpenBSD
second stage boot loader</a> properly, and only 16M may be detected
and used by OpenBSD. This can be corrected either by creating/editing
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot.conf&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386"><tt>/etc/boot.conf</tt></a>
file, or by entering commands at the "<tt>boot></tt>" prompt before
OpenBSD loads.  If you had a machine with 64M RAM, but OpenBSD was only
detecting the first 16M, the command you would use would be:

<pre>
     machine mem +0x3000000@0x1000000
</pre>
to add 48M (<tt>0x3000000</tt>) after the first 16M
(<tt>0x1000000</tt>).  Typically, if you had a machine with this
problem, you would enter the above command first at the install
floppy/CDROM's <tt>boot></tt> prompt, load the system, reboot, and
create a <tt>/etc/boot.conf</tt> file with the above line in it so all
future bootings will recognize all available RAM.

<p>
It has also been reported that a ROM update will fix this on <i>some</i>
systems.

<a name="noboot"></a>
<h3>4.10.3 - My i386 won't boot after install</h3>
Your install seemed to go fine, but on first boot, you see no sign of
OpenBSD attempting to boot.  There are a few common reasons for this
problem:

<ul>
<li><b>No partition was flagged active in fdisk(8).</b>  To fix this,
reboot the machine using the boot floppy or media, and "flag" a 
partition as "active" (bootable).  See 
<a href="faq14.html#fdisk">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">here</a>

<li><b>No valid boot loader was ever put on the disk.</b>
If you answer "Y" to the "Use entire disk for OpenBSD?" question during
the install, or use the "<tt>reinit</tt>" option of fdisk(8), the
OpenBSD boot record is installed on the Master Boot Record of the disk;
otherwise, the existing master boot code is untouched.  This will be a
problem if no other boot record existed.  The solution is to boot the
install media again, drop to the shell and invoke
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">fdisk(8)</a>
and use the "<tt>update</tt>" option.  

<li><b>In some rare occasions, something may go wrong with the second
stage boot loader install.</b>  Reinstalling the second stage boot
loader is discussed <a href="faq14.html#InstBoot">here</a>.

<li><b>You mixed <i>a.out</i> and <i>ELF</i> boot disk and install
files.</b>  OpenBSD/i386 has transitioned from the older <i>a.out</i>
format to the <i>ELF</i> format for binaries after 3.3-release.  The
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">3.3-current snapshot's</a>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">boot
loader</a> can not boot an OpenBSD 3.3-release's kernel, nor can the
3.3-release boot loader boot a <i>-current</i> kernel.  You must use a
boot disk that matches the version of OpenBSD you intend to install.
Failure to follow this will show itself with a message such as
"<tt>failure(79)</tt>" and/or "<tt>Inappropriate file type or
format</tt>".

<li><b>You ignored all the <a href="#Disks">warnings</a> and
<a href="#SpaceNeeded">explanations</a> about the
<a href="faq14.html#LargeDrive">8G boot limit</a>.</b>  This
results in a hang at the very start of the boot process, sometimes with
the message, "<tt>Bad magic</tt>".

</ul>

<a name="sshhang"></a>
<h3>4.10.4 - My (older, slower) machine booted, but hung at the ssh-keygen
steps</h3>
It is very likely your machine is running fine, just taking a while
to do the ssh key generation process.  A SparcStation2 or a Macintosh
Quadra may take 45 minutes or more to complete the three
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh-keygen&amp;sektion=1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>
steps, some machines will take even longer.  Just let it finish; it is
only done once per install.

<h3>4.10.5 - I got the message "ftplist: No such file" when doing an
install</h3>

When doing an FTP install of a 
<a href="upgrade-minifaq.html#1.1">snapshot</a> during the <i>-beta</i>
stage of the <a href="faq5.html#Flavors">OpenBSD development cycle</a>,
you may see this:

  Do you want to see a list of potential FTP servers?  [y] <i>ENTER</i>
  grep: /tmp/ftplist: No such file or directory
  Server IP address or hostname? 
</pre></td></tr></table>

This is normal and expected behavior during this pre-release part of the
cycle.  The install program looks for the FTP list on the primary FTP
server in a directory that won't be available until the
<a href="faq1.html#Next">release date</a>, so you get the above message.

<p>
Simply use the <a href="../ftp.html">FTP mirror list</a> to find your
favorite FTP mirror, and manually enter its name when prompted.

<p>
<b>Note: You should not see this if you are installing <i>-release</i>
or from CDROM.</b>

<h2>4.11 - Customizing the Install Process</h2>
<!-- XXXversion -->

<h3><tt>siteXX.tgz</tt> file</h3>
The OpenBSD install/upgrade scripts allow the selection of a
user-created set called "<tt>siteXX.tgz</tt>", where XX is the release
version (e.g. 33).  The <tt>siteXX.tgz</tt> file set is, like the other
<a href="#FilesNeeded">file sets</a>, a
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=gzip&amp;sektion=1">gzip(1)</a>
compressed
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tar&amp;sektion=1">tar(1)</a>
archive rooted in '/' and is un-tarred like the other sets with the
options <tt>xzpf</tt>.  This set will be installed last, after
all other file sets.

<p>
This file set allows the user to add to and/or override the files
installed in the 'normal' sets and thus customize the installation or
upgrade.

<p>
Some example uses of a <tt>siteXX.tgz</tt> file:
<ul>
<li>Create a siteXX.tgz file that contains all the file changes you made
since first installing OpenBSD. Then, if you have to re-create the
system you simply select siteXX.tgz during the re-install and all of
your changes are replicated on the new system.

<li>Create a series of machine specific directories that each contain a
siteXX.tgz file that contains files specific to those machine types.
Installation of machines (e.g. boxes with different graphics cards) of a
particular category can be completed by selecting the appropriate
siteXX.tgz file.

<li>Put the files you routinely customize in a same or similar way
in a siteXX.tgz file --
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=adduser&amp;sektion=8"
><tt>/etc/skel</tt></a> files,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf.conf&amp;sektion=5"
><tt>/etc/pf.conf</tt></a>, 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=httpd&amp;sektion=8"
><tt>/var/www/conf/httpd.conf</tt></a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rc.conf&amp;sektion=5"
><tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt></a>,
etc. 
</ul>

<h3><tt>install.site</tt>/<tt>upgrade.site</tt> scripts</h3>
As the last step in the install/upgrade process, the scripts look in the
root directory of the newly installed/upgraded system for
<tt>install.site</tt> or <tt>upgrade.site</tt>, as appropriate to the
current process, and runs this script in an environment
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=chroot&amp;sektion=8">chroot</a>ed
to the installed/upgraded system's root.  Remember, the upgrade is done
from a booted file system, so your target file system is actually
mounted on <tt>/mnt</tt>.  However, your script can be written as if it
it is running in the "normal" root of your file system.  Since this
script is run after all the files are installed, you have almost full
functionality of your system (though, in single user mode) when your
script runs.

<p>
Note that the <tt>install.site</tt> script would have to be in a
<tt>siteXX.tgz file</tt>, while the <tt>upgrade.site</tt> script could
be put in the root directory before the upgrade, or could be put in a
<tt>siteXX.tgz</tt> file.

<p>
The scripts can be used to do anything possible in a script.
<ul>
<li>Remove files that are installed/upgraded that you don't want present
on the system.
<li> Remove/upgrade/install the
<a href="faq8.html#Packages">packages</a> you want on the installed
system.
<li> Do an <a href="faq14.html#Backup">immediate backup/archive</a> of
the new system before you expose it to the rest of the world.
</ul>

The combination of <tt>siteXX.tgz</tt> and
<tt>install.site/upgrade.site</tt> files is intended to give the user
broad customization capabilities without having to build their own
custom install sets.

<h2>4.12 - How can I install a number of similar systems?</h2>
Here are some tools you can use when you have to deploy a number 
of similar OpenBSD systems.

<h3><tt>siteXX.tgz</tt> and <tt>install/upgrade.site</tt> files</h3>
See the <a href="#site">above</a> article.

<h3>Restore from Dump</h3>
On most platforms, the boot media includes the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=restore&amp;sektion=8">restore(8)</a>
program, which can be used to restore a backup made by 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dump&amp;sektion=8">dump(8)</a>.
Thus, you could boot from a 
<a href="#MkFlop">floppy</a>, 
<a href="../orders.html">CD</a>, or
<a href="#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file, then
<a href="faq14.html#fdisk">fdisk</a>,
<a href="faq14.html#disklabel">disklabel</a>, and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=restore&amp;sektion=8">restore</a>
the desired configuration from tape or other media, and install the
<a href="faq14.html#InstBoot">boot blocks</a>. More details 
<a href="faq14.html#Backup">here</a>.

<h3>Disk Imaging</h3>
Unfortunately, there are no known disk imaging packages which are
FFS-aware and can make an image containing only the active file space.
Most of the major disk imaging solutions will treat an OpenBSD partition
as a "generic" partition, and can make an image of the whole disk. This
often accomplishes your goal, but usually with huge amounts of wasted
space --  an empty, 10G <tt>/home</tt> partition will require 10G of
space in the image, even if there isn't a single file in it.  While you
can typically install a drive image to a larger drive, you would not be
able to directly use the extra space, and you would not be able to
install an image to a smaller drive.

<p>
If this is an acceptable situation, you may find the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&amp;sektion=1">dd</a>
command will do what you need, allowing you to copy one disk to another,
sector-for-sector.  This would provide the same functionality as
commercial programs without the cost.

<a name="getdmesg"></a>
<h2>4.13 - How can I get a dmesg(8) to report an install problem?</h2>
When <a href="../report.html">reporting a problem</a>, it is critical to
include the complete system
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dmesg&amp;sektion=8">dmesg(8)</a>.
However, often when you need to do this, it is because the system is
working improperly or won't install so you may not have disk, network,
or other resources you need to get the dmesg to the appropriate
<a href="../mail.html">mail list</a>.  There are other ways, however:

<ul>
<li><b>Floppy disk:</b>  The boot disks and CDROM has enough tools
to let you record your dmesg to an MSDOS floppy disk for reading on
another machine.  Place an MSDOS formatted floppy in your disk drive and
execute the following commands:

<pre>
     mount -t msdos /dev/fd0a /mnt
     dmesg >/mnt/dmesg.txt
     umount /mnt
</pre>
If you have another OpenBSD system, you can also write it to an OpenBSD
compatible floppy -- often, the boot floppy has enough room on it to
hold the dmesg.  In that case, leave off the "<tt>-t msdos</tt>" above.

<p>
<li><b>Serial Console:</b> See <a href="faq7.html#SerCon">this article</a>
on setting up the serial console, then capture the output to a file.

<p>
<li><b>FTP:</b>  Under some circumstances, you may be able to use the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftp&amp;sektion=1">ftp(1)</a>
client on the boot disk or CDROM to send the dmesg to a local FTP
server, where you can retrieve it later.
</ul>
