<h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>

A list allows the specification of multiple similar criteria within a rule.
For example, multiple protocols, port numbers, addresses, etc.
So, instead of writing one filter rule for each IP address that needs to
be blocked, one rule can be written by specifying the IP addresses in a list.
Lists are defined by specifying items within <code>{ }</code> brackets.

<p>
When
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl">pfctl(8)</a> encounters a list during
loading of the ruleset, it creates multiple rules, one for each item in the
list.
For example:

<pre class="cmdbox">
block out on fxp0 from { 192.168.0.1, 10.5.32.6 } to any
</pre>

gets expanded to:

<pre class="cmdbox">
block out on fxp0 from 192.168.0.1 to any
block out on fxp0 from 10.5.32.6 to any
</pre>

Multiple lists can be specified within a rule:

<pre class="cmdbox">
match in on fxp0 proto tcp to port { 22 80 } rdr-to 192.168.0.6
block out on fxp0 proto { tcp udp } from { 192.168.0.1, 10.5.32.6 } \
   to any port { ssh https }
</pre>

The commas between list items are optional.

<p>
Lists can also contain nested lists:

<pre class="cmdbox">
trusted = "{ 192.168.1.2 192.168.5.36 }"
pass in inet proto tcp from { 10.10.0.0/24 $trusted } to port 22
</pre>

Beware of constructs like the following, dubbed "negated lists," which are
a common mistake:

<pre class="cmdbox">
pass in on fxp0 from { 10.0.0.0/8, !10.1.2.3 }
</pre>

While the intended meaning is usually to match "any address within 10.0.0.0/8,
except for 10.1.2.3," the rule expands to:

<pre class="cmdbox">
pass in on fxp0 from 10.0.0.0/8
pass in on fxp0 from !10.1.2.3
</pre>

which matches any possible address.
Instead, a <a href="tables.html">table</a> should be used.

<h2 id="macros">Macros</h2>

Macros are user-defined variables that can hold IP addresses, port numbers,
interface names, etc.
Macros can reduce the complexity of a PF ruleset and also make maintaining
a ruleset much easier.

<p>
Macro names must start with a letter and may contain letters, digits and
underscores.
Macro names cannot be reserved words such as <code>pass</code>, <code>out</code>
or <code>queue</code>.

<pre class="cmdbox">
ext_if = "fxp0"

block in on $ext_if from any to any
</pre>

This creates a macro named <code>ext_if</code>.
When a macro is referred to after it's been created, its name is preceded
with a <code>$</code> character.

<p>
Macros can also expand to lists, such as:

<pre class="cmdbox">
friends = "{ 192.168.1.1, 10.0.2.5, 192.168.43.53 }"
</pre>

Macros can be defined recursively.
Since macros are not expanded within quotes the following syntax must be used:

<pre class="cmdbox">
host1      = "192.168.1.1"
host2      = "192.168.1.2"
all_hosts  = "{" $host1 $host2 "}"
</pre>

The macro <code>$all_hosts</code> now expands to 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2.
