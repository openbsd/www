<p>
Packet Filter (from here on referred to as PF) is OpenBSD's system
for filtering TCP/IP traffic and doing Network Address Translation. PF
is also capable of normalizing and conditioning TCP/IP traffic and
providing bandwidth control and packet prioritization. PF has been a
part of the GENERIC OpenBSD kernel since OpenBSD 3.0. Previous OpenBSD
releases used a different firewall/NAT package which is no longer
supported.

<p>
PF was originally developed by Daniel Hartmeier and is now maintained and
developed by Daniel and the rest of the OpenBSD team.  

<p>
This set of documents, also available in
<a href="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/doc/pf-faq.pdf">PDF</a>
format, is intended as a general introduction to the
PF system as run on OpenBSD. Even if it covers all of PF's major
features, it is only intended to be used as a supplement
to the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi"
>man pages</a>, and not as a replacement for them.

<p>
For a complete and in-depth view of what PF can do, please start by
reading the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf&amp;sektion=4&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.7"
>pf(4)</a> man page.

<p>
As with the rest of the FAQ, this set of documents is focused on users of
<a href="../../37.html">OpenBSD 3.7</a>. As PF is always growing and
developing, there are changes and enhancements between the 3.7-release
version and the version in OpenBSD-current. The reader is advised to see
the man pages for the version of OpenBSD they are currently working
with.
