<font color="#e00000">PF: Address Pools and Load Balancing</font>
</h1>

<hr>

<p>
An address pool is a supply of two or more addresses whose use is shared
among a group of users. An address pool can be specified as the
redirection address in <a href="rdr.html"><tt>rdr</tt></a> rules, as the
translation address in <a href="nat.html"><tt>nat</tt></a> rules, and as
the target address in <tt>route-to</tt>, <tt>reply-to</tt>, and
<tt>dup-to</tt> <a href="filter.html">filter</a> options.

<p>
There are four methods for using an address pool:
<ul>
<li><tt>bitmask</tt> - grafts the network portion of the pool
address over top of the address that is being modified (source address
for <tt>nat</tt> rules, destination address for <tt>rdr</tt> rules).
Example: if the address pool is 192.0.2.1/24 and the address being 
modified is 10.0.0.50, then the resulting address will be 192.0.2.50. If
the address pool is 192.0.2.1/25 and the address being modified is
10.0.0.130, then the resulting address will be 192.0.2.2. 
<li><tt>random</tt> - randomly selects an address from the pool.
<li><tt>source-hash</tt> - uses a hash of the source address to
determine which address to use from the pool. This method ensures that a
given source address is always mapped to the same pool address.
The key that is fed to the hashing algorithm can optionally be specified
after the <tt>source-hash</tt> keyword in hex format or as a string. By
default
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pfctl&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.3">
pfctl(8)</a> will generate a random key every time the ruleset is
loaded. 
<li><tt>round-robin</tt> - loops through the address pool in
sequence. This is the default method.
</ul>

<p>
Except for the <tt>round-robin</tt> method, the address pool must be
expressed as a 
<a href="http://public.pacbell.net/dedicated/cidr.html">CIDR</a>
(Classless Inter-Domain Routing) network block. The <tt>round-robin</tt>
method will accept multiple individual addresses using
<a href="macros.html#lists">list format</a>.

<p>
In addition, the <tt>static-port</tt> keyword can be specified after
one of the above methods to prevent <tt>nat</tt> rules from
modifying the source port of TCP and UDP packets.

<a name="nat"></a>
<h2>NAT Address Pool</h2>
An address pool can be used as the translation address in 
<a href="nat.html"><tt>nat</tt></a> rules. Connections will have their
source address translated to an address from the pool based on the
method chosen. This can be useful in situations where PF is performing
NAT for a very large network. Since the number of NATed connections per
translation address is limited, adding additional translation addresses
will allow the NAT gateway to scale to serve a larger number of users.

<p>
In this example a pool of two addresses is being used to translate
outgoing packets. For each outgoing connection PF will rotate through
the addresses in a round-robin manner.
<blockquote>
<tt>
nat on $ext_if inet from any to any -&gt; { 192.0.2.5, 192.0.2.10 }
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
One drawback with this method is that successive connections from the
same internal address will not always be translated to the same
translation address.  This can cause interference, for example, when
browsing websites that track user logins based on IP address. An
alternate approach is to use the <tt>source-hash</tt> method so that
each internal address is always translated to the same translation
address. To do this, the address pool must be a
<a href="http://public.pacbell.net/dedicated/cidr.html">CIDR</a>
network block.
<blockquote>
<tt>
nat on $ext_if inet from any to any -&gt; 192.0.2.4/31 source-hash
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
This <tt>nat</tt> rule uses the address pool 192.0.2.4/31 (192.0.2.4 -
192.0.2.5) as the translation address for outgoing packets. Each
internal address will always be translated to the same translation
address because of the <tt>source-hash</tt> keyword.

<a name="incoming"></a>
<h2>Load Balance Incoming Connections</h2>
Address pools can also be used to load balance incoming connections. For
example, incoming web server connections can be distributed across a web
server farm:
<blockquote>
<tt>
web_servers = "{ 10.0.0.10, 10.0.0.11, 10.0.0.13 }"<br>
<br>
rdr on $ext_if proto tcp from any to any port 80 -&gt; $web_servers
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Successive connections will be redirected to the web servers in a
round-robin manner. 

<p>
As with the NAT example, if the web servers are all placed within a CIDR
network block, the <tt>source-hash</tt> keyword can be used so that
connections from a given IP address are always redirected to the same
physical web server. Again, this is sometimes necessary to maintain
session information while browsing a website.

<a name="outgoing"></a>
<h2>Load Balance Outgoing Traffic</h2>
Address pools can be used in combination with the <tt>route-to</tt>
filter option to load balance two or more Internet connections when a
proper multi-path routing protocol (like 
<a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1771.txt">BGP4</a>) is
unavailable. By using <tt>route-to</tt> with a <tt>round-robin</tt>
address pool, outbound connections can be evenly distributed among
multiple outbound paths. 

<p>
One additional piece of information that's needed to do this is the IP
address of the adjacent router on each Internet connection. This is fed
to the <tt>route-to</tt> option to control the destination of outgoing
packets.

<p>
The following example balances outgoing traffic across two Internet
connections:
<blockquote>
<tt>
lan_net = "192.168.0.0/24"<br>
int_if &nbsp;= "dc0"<br>
ext_if1 = "fxp0"<br>
ext_if2 = "fxp1"<br>
ext_gw1 = "68.146.224.1"<br>
ext_gw2 = "142.59.76.1"<br>
<br>
pass in on $int_if route-to \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ ($ext_if1 $ext_gw1), ($ext_if2 $ext_gw2) } round-robin \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from $lan_net to any keep state
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <tt>route-to</tt> option is used on traffic coming <i>in</i> on the
<i>internal</i> interface to specify the outgoing network interfaces
that traffic will be balanced across along with their respective
gateways. Note that the <tt>route-to</tt> option must be present on
<i>each</i> filter rule that traffic is to be balanced for.  Return
packets will be routed back to the same external interface that they
exited (this is done by the ISPs) and will be routed back to the
internal network normally.

<p>
To ensure that packets with a source address belonging to
<tt>$ext_if1</tt> are always routed to <tt>$ext_gw1</tt> (and similarly
for <tt>$ext_if2</tt> and <tt>$ext_gw2</tt>) the following two lines
should be included in the ruleset:
<blockquote>
<tt>
pass out on $ext_if1 route-to ($ext_if2 $ext_gw2) from $ext_if2 \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to any<br>
pass out on $ext_if2 route-to ($ext_if1 $ext_gw1) from $ext_if1 \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to any 
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Finally, NAT can also be used on each outgoing interface:
<blockquote>
<tt>
nat on $ext_if1 from $lan_net to any -&gt; ($ext_if1)<br>
nat on $ext_if2 from $lan_net to any -&gt; ($ext_if2)
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
A complete example might look something like this:

#  nat outgoing connections on each internet interface
