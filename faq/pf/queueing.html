<h2>Queueing</h2>
<p>
To queue something is to store it, in order, while it awaits
processing. In a computer network, when data packets are sent out from a
host, they enter a queue where they await processing by the operating
system.  The operating system then decides which queue and which
packet(s) from that queue should be processed. The order in which the
operating system selects the packets to process can affect network
performance. For example, imagine a user running two network
applications: SSH and FTP. Ideally, the SSH packets should be
processed before the FTP packets because of the time-sensitive nature
of SSH; when a key is typed in the SSH client, an immediate response 
is expected, but an FTP transfer being delayed by a few extra
seconds hardly bears any notice.  But what happens if the router
handling these connections processes a large chunk of packets from the
FTP connection before processing the SSH connection? Packets from the
SSH connection will remain in the queue (or possibly be dropped by the
router if the queue isn't big enough to hold all of the packets)
and the SSH session may appear to lag or slow down.  By modifying the
queueing strategy being used, network bandwidth can be shared fairly
between different applications, users, and computers.

<p>
Note that queueing is only useful for packets in the <i>outbound</i>
direction. Once a packet arrives on an interface in the inbound
direction it's already too late to queue it -- it's already consumed
network bandwidth to get to the interface that just received it. The
only solution is to enable queueing on the adjacent router or, if the
host that received the packet is acting as a router, to enable queueing
on the internal interface where packets exit the router.

<a name="sched"></a>
<h2>Schedulers</h2>
The scheduler is what decides which queues to process and in what order.
By default, OpenBSD uses a First In First Out (FIFO) scheduler. A FIFO
queue works like the line-up at a supermarket's checkout -- the first
item into the queue is the first processed. As new packets arrive they
are added to the end of the queue. If the queue becomes full, and here
the analogy with the supermarket stops, newly arriving packets are dropped.
This is known as tail-drop.

<p>
OpenBSD supports two additional schedulers:
<ul>
<li>Class Based Queueing
<li>Priority Queueing
</ul>

<a name="cbq"></a>
<h3>Class Based Queueing</h3>
Class Based Queueing (CBQ) is a queueing algorithm that divides a
network connection's bandwidth among multiple queues or classes.  Each
queue then has traffic assigned to it based on source or destination
address, port number, protocol, etc.  A queue may optionally be
configured to borrow bandwidth from its parent queue if the parent is
being under-utilized.  Queues are also given a priority such that those
containing interactive traffic, such as SSH, can have their packets
processed ahead of queues containing bulk traffic, such as FTP.

<p>
CBQ queues are arranged in an hierarchical manner.  At the top of the
hierarchy is the root queue which defines the total amount of bandwidth
available.  Child queues are created under the root queue, each of
which can be assigned some portion of the root queue's bandwidth.  For
example, queues might be defined as follows:
<dl>
<dd>Root Queue (2Mbps)
	<dl>
	<dd>Queue A (1Mbps)
	<dd>Queue B (500Kbps)
	<dd>Queue C (500Kbps)
	</dl>
</dl>

<p>
In this case, the total available bandwidth is set to 2 megabits per
second (Mbps). This bandwidth is then split among three child queues.

<p>
The hierarchy can further be expanded by defining queues within queues.
To split bandwidth equally among different users and also classify their
traffic so that certain protocols don't starve others for bandwidth, a
queueing structure like this might be defined:
<dl>
<dd>Root Queue (2Mbps)
	<dl>
	<dd>UserA (1Mbps)
		<dl>
		<dd>ssh (50Kbps)
		<dd>bulk (950Kbps)
		</dl>
	<dd>UserB (1Mbps)
		<dl>
		<dd>audio (250Kbps)
		<dd>bulk (750Kbps)
			<dl>
			<dd>http (100Kbps)
			<dd>other (650Kbps)
			</dl>
		</dl>
	</dl>
</dl>

<p>
Note that at each level the sum of the bandwidth assigned to each of the
queues is not more than the bandwidth assigned to the parent queue.

<p>
A queue can be configured to borrow bandwidth from its parent if the
parent has excess bandwidth available due to it not being used by
the other child queues.  Consider a queueing setup like this:
<dl>
<dd>Root Queue (2Mbps)
	<dl>
	<dd>UserA (1Mbps)
		<dl>
		<dd>ssh (100Kbps)
		<dd>ftp (900Kbps, borrow)
		</dl>
	<dd>UserB (1Mbps)
	</dl>
</dl>

<p>
If traffic in the <tt>ftp</tt> queue exceeds 900Kbps and traffic in the
<tt>UserA</tt> queue is less than 1Mbps (because the <tt>ssh</tt> queue is using
less than its assigned 100Kbps), the <tt>ftp</tt> queue will borrow the
excess bandwidth from <tt>UserA</tt>.  In this way the <tt>ftp</tt>
queue is able to use more than its assigned bandwidth when it faces
overload.  When the <tt>ssh</tt> queue increases its load, the borrowed
bandwidth will be returned.

<p>
CBQ assigns each queue a priority level. Queues with a higher priority
are preferred during congestion over queues with a lower priority as
long as both queues share the same parent (in other words, as long as
both queues are on the same branch in the hierarchy).  Queues with the
same priority are processed in a round-robin fashion.  For example:
<dl>
<dd>Root Queue (2Mbps)
	<dl>
	<dd>UserA (1Mbps, priority 1)
		<dl>
		<dd>ssh (100Kbps, priority 5)
		<dd>ftp (900Kbps, priority 3)
		</dl>
	<dd>UserB (1Mbps, priority 1)
	</dl>
</dl>

<p>
CBQ will process the <tt>UserA</tt> and <tt>UserB</tt> queues in a
round-robin fashion -- neither queue will be preferred over the other.
During the time when the <tt>UserA</tt> queue is being processed, CBQ
will also process its child queues.  In this case, the <tt>ssh</tt>
queue has a higher priority and will be given preferential treatment
over the <tt>ftp</tt> queue if the network is congested.  Note how the
<tt>ssh</tt> and <tt>ftp</tt> queues do not have their priorities
compared to the <tt>UserA</tt> and <tt>UserB</tt> queues because they
are not all on the same branch in the hierarchy.

<p>
For a more detailed look at the theory behind CBQ, please see
<a href="http://www.icir.org/floyd/cbq.html">References on CBQ</a>.

<a name="priq"></a>
<h3>Priority Queueing</h3>
Priority Queueing (PRIQ) assigns multiple queues to a network
interface with each queue being given a unique priority level. A queue
with a higher priority is <i>always</i> processed ahead of a queue with
a lower priority. 

<p>
The queueing structure in PRIQ is flat -- you cannot define queues
within queues. The root queue is defined, which sets the total amount of
bandwidth that is available, and then sub queues are defined under the
root. Consider the following example:
<dl>
<dd>Root Queue (2Mbps)
	<dl>
	<dd>Queue A (priority 1)
	<dd>Queue B (priority 2)
	<dd>Queue C (priority 3)
	</dl>
</dl>

<p>
The root queue is defined as having 2Mbps of bandwidth available to it
and three subqueues are defined. The queue with the highest priority
(the highest priority number) is served first. Once all the packets
in that queue are processed, or if the queue is found to be empty, PRIQ
moves onto the queue with the next highest priority.  Within a given
queue, packets are processed in a First In First Out (FIFO) manner.

<p>
It is important to note that when using PRIQ you must plan your queues
very carefully.  Because PRIQ <i>always</i> processes a higher priority
queue before a lower priority one, it's possible for a high priority
queue to cause packets in a lower priority queue to be delayed or
dropped if the high priority queue is receiving a constant stream of
packets.

<a name="red"></a>
<h3>Random Early Detection</h3>
Random Early Detection (RED) is a congestion avoidance algorithm. Its
job is to avoid network congestion by making sure that the queue doesn't
become full. It does this by continually calculating the average length
(size) of the queue and comparing it to two thresholds, a minimum
threshold and a maximum threshold. If the average queue size is below
the minimum threshold then no packets will be dropped. If the average is
above the maximum threshold then <i>all</i> newly arriving packets will
be dropped. If the average is between the threshold values then packets
are dropped based on a probability calculated from the average queue
size. In other words, as the average queue size approaches the maximum
threshold, more and more packets are dropped. When dropping packets,
RED randomly chooses which connections to drop packets from.
Connections using larger amounts of bandwidth have a higher probability
of having their packets dropped.

<p>
RED is useful because it avoids a situation known as global
synchronization and it is able to accommodate bursts of traffic.  Global
synchronization refers to a loss of total throughput due to packets
being dropped from several connections at the same time. For example, if
congestion occurs at a router carrying traffic for 10 FTP connections
and packets from all (or most) of these connections are dropped (as is
the case with FIFO queueing), overall throughput will drop sharply. This
isn't an ideal situation because it causes all of the FTP connections to
reduce their throughput and also means that the network is no longer
being used to its maximum potential.  RED avoids this by randomly
choosing which connections to drop packets from instead of choosing all
of them. Connections using large amounts of bandwidth have a higher
chance of their packets being dropped. In this way, high bandwidth
connections will be throttled back, congestion will be avoided, and
sharp losses of overall throughput will not occur. In addition, RED is
able to handle bursts of traffic because it starts to drop packets
<i>before</i> the queue becomes full. When a burst of traffic comes
through there will be enough space in the queue to hold the new packets.

<p>
RED should only be used when the transport protocol is capable of
responding to congestion indicators from the network. In most cases
this means RED should be used to queue TCP traffic and not UDP or ICMP
traffic.

<p>
For a more detailed look at the theory behind RED, please see
<a href="http://www.icir.org/floyd/red.html">References on RED</a>.

<a name="ecn"></a>
<h3>Explicit Congestion Notification</h3>
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) works in conjunction with RED to
notify two hosts communicating over the network of any congestion along
the communication path. It does this by enabling RED to set a flag in
the packet header instead of dropping the packet. Assuming the sending
host has support for ECN, it can then read this flag and throttle back
its network traffic accordingly.

<p>
For more information on ECN, please refer to 
<a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3168.txt">RFC 3168</a>.

<a name="altq"></a>
<h2>Configuring Queueing</h2>
Since OpenBSD 3.0 the 
<a href="http://www.csl.sony.co.jp/person/kjc/kjc/software.html#ALTQ"
>Alternate Queueing (ALTQ)</a> queueing implementation has been a part of
the base system. Starting with OpenBSD 3.3 ALTQ has been integrated into
PF.  OpenBSD's ALTQ implementation supports the Class Based Queueing
(CBQ) and Priority Queueing (PRIQ) schedulers. It also supports Random
Early Detection (RED) and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).

<p>
Because ALTQ has been merged with PF, PF must be enabled for queueing to
work. Instructions on how to enable PF can be found in
<a href="config.html#activate">Getting Started</a>.

<p>
Queueing is configured in <tt>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf.conf&amp;sektion=5&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.6"
>pf.conf</a></tt>. There are two types of directives that are used
to configure queueing:
<ul>
<li><tt>altq on</tt> - enables queueing on an interface, defines which
scheduler to use, and creates the root queue
<li><tt>queue</tt> - defines the properties of a child queue
</ul>

<p>
The syntax for the <tt>altq on</tt> directive is:
<blockquote>
<tt>
altq on <i>interface scheduler</i> bandwidth <i>bw</i> qlimit 
<i>qlim</i> \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tbrsize <i>size</i> queue { <i>queue_list</i> }
</tt>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><tt><i>interface</i></tt> - the network interface to activate queueing on.
<li><tt><i>scheduler</i></tt> - the queueing scheduler to use. Possible values are 
<tt>cbq</tt> and <tt>priq</tt>. Only one scheduler may be active on an
interface at a time.
<li><tt><i>bw</i></tt> - the total amount of bandwidth available to the scheduler.
This may be specified as an absolute value using the suffixes <tt>b</tt>,
<tt>Kb</tt>, <tt>Mb</tt>, and <tt>Gb</tt> to represent bits, kilobits,
megabits, and gigabits per second, respectively or as a percentage of the
<tt><i>interface</i></tt> bandwidth.
<li><tt><i>qlim</i></tt> - the maximum number of packets to hold in the queue. 
This parameter is optional. The default is 50.
<li><tt><i>size</i></tt> - the size of the token bucket regulator in bytes. If not
specified, the size is set based on the <tt><i>interface</i></tt> bandwidth.
<li><tt><i>queue_list</i></tt> - a list of child queues to create under the root
queue.
</ul>

<p>
For example:
<blockquote>
<tt>
altq on fxp0 cbq bandwidth 2Mb queue { std, ssh, ftp }
</tt>
</blockquote>
This enables CBQ on the <tt>fxp0</tt> interface. The total bandwidth available is
set to 2Mbps. Three child queues are defined: <tt>std</tt>,
<tt>ssh</tt>, and <tt>ftp</tt>.

<p>
The syntax for the <tt>queue</tt> directive is:
<blockquote>
<tt>
queue <i>name</i> [on <i>interface</i>] bandwidth <i>bw</i> [priority 
<i>pri</i>] [qlimit <i>qlim</i>] \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>scheduler</i> ( <i>sched_options</i> )
{ <i>queue_list</i> }
</tt>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><tt><i>name</i></tt> - the name of the queue. This must match the
name of one of the queues defined in the <tt>altq on</tt> directive's
<tt><i>queue_list</i></tt>. For <tt>cbq</tt> it can also match the name
of a queue in a previous <tt>queue</tt> directive's
<tt><i>queue_list</i></tt>. Queue names must be no longer than 15 characters.
<li><tt><i>interface</i></tt> - the network interface that the queue is
valid on. This value is optional, and when not specified, will make
the queue valid on all interfaces.
<li><tt><i>bw</i></tt> - the total amount of bandwidth available to the
queue.
This may be specified as an absolute value using the suffixes <tt>b</tt>,
<tt>Kb</tt>, <tt>Mb</tt>, and <tt>Gb</tt> to represent bits, kilobits,
megabits, and gigabits per second, respectively or as a percentage of the
parent queue's bandwidth.
This parameter is only applicable when using the <tt>cbq</tt> scheduler.
<li><tt><i>pri</i></tt> - the priority of the queue. For <tt>cbq</tt> the
priority range is 0 to 7 and for <tt>priq</tt> the range is 0 to 15.
Priority 0 is the lowest priority. When not specified, a default of 1 is
used.
<li><tt><i>qlim</i></tt> - the maximum number of packets to hold in the queue. 
When not specified, a default of 50 is used.
<li><tt><i>scheduler</i></tt> - the scheduler being used, either <tt>cbq</tt>
or <tt>priq</tt>. Must be the same as the root queue.
<li><tt><i>sched_options</i></tt> - further options may be passed to the scheduler
to control its behavior:
	<ul>
	<li><tt>default</tt> - defines a default queue where all packets not
	matching any other queue will be queued. Exactly one default queue
	is required.
	<li><tt>red</tt> - enables Random Early Detection (RED) on this queue.
	<li><tt>rio</tt> - enables RED with IN/OUT. In this mode, RED will
	maintain multiple average queue lengths and multiple threshold
	values, one for each IP Quality of Service level.
	<li><tt>ecn</tt> - enables Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) on
	this queue. <tt>Ecn</tt> implies <tt>red</tt>.
	<li><tt>borrow</tt> - the queue can borrow bandwidth from its parent. This can
	only be specified when using the <tt>cbq</tt> scheduler.
	</ul>
<li><tt><i>queue_list</i></tt> - a list of child queues to create under this
queue. A <tt><i>queue_list</i></tt> may only be defined when using the
<tt>cbq</tt> scheduler.
</ul>

<p>
Continuing with the example above:
<blockquote>
<tt>
queue std bandwidth 50% cbq(default)<br>
queue ssh { ssh_login, ssh_bulk }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;queue ssh_login  priority 4 cbq(ecn)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;queue ssh_bulk   cbq(ecn)<br>
queue ftp bandwidth 500Kb priority 3 cbq(borrow red)<br>
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here the parameters of the previously defined child queues are set. The
<tt>std</tt> queue is assigned a bandwidth of 50% of the root queue's
bandwidth (or 1Mbps) and is set as the default queue. The <tt>ssh</tt>
queue defines two child queues, <tt>ssh_login</tt> and
<tt>ssh_bulk</tt>. The <tt>ssh_login</tt> queue is given a higher
priority than <tt>ssh_bulk</tt> and both have ECN enabled.  The
<tt>ftp</tt> queue is assigned a bandwidth of 500Kbps and given a
priority of 3. It can also borrow bandwidth when extra is available and
has RED enabled. 

<a name="assign"></a>
<h3>Assigning Traffic to a Queue</h3>
<p>
To assign traffic to a queue, the <tt>queue</tt> keyword is used in
conjunction with PF's <a href="filter.html">filter rules</a>. For example,
consider a set of filtering rules containing a line such as:
<blockquote>
<tt>pass out on fxp0 from any to any port 22</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Packets matching that rule can be assigned to a specific queue by using
the <tt>queue</tt> keyword:
<blockquote>
<tt>pass out on fxp0 from any to any port 22 queue ssh</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
When using the <tt>queue</tt> keyword with <tt>block</tt> directives, any
resulting TCP RST or ICMP Unreachable packets are assigned to the specified
queue.

<p>
Note that queue designation can happen on an interface other than the one
defined in the <tt>altq on</tt> directive:
<blockquote>
<tt> 
altq on fxp0 cbq bandwidth 2Mb queue { std, ftp }<br>
queue std cbq(default)<br>
queue ftp bandwidth 1.5Mb<br>
<br>
pass in on dc0 from any to any port 21 queue ftp<br>
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Queueing is enabled on <tt>fxp0</tt> but the designation takes place
on <tt>dc0</tt>. 
If packets matching the <tt>pass</tt> rule exit from interface 
<tt>fxp0</tt>, they will be queued in the <tt>ftp</tt> queue. 
This type of queueing can be very useful on routers.

<p>
Normally only one queue name is given with the <tt>queue</tt> keyword,
but if a second name is specified that queue will be used for packets
with a <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc791.txt">Type of
Service (ToS)</a> of low-delay and for TCP ACK packets with no data payload.
A good example of this is found when using SSH. SSH login sessions will
set the ToS to low-delay while SCP and SFTP sessions will not. PF can
use this information to queue packets belonging to a login connection in a
different queue than non-login connections. This can be useful to prioritize
login connection packets over file transfer packets.
<blockquote>
<tt>pass out on fxp0 from any to any port 22 queue(ssh_bulk, ssh_login)</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
This assigns packets belonging to SSH login connections to the
<tt>ssh_login</tt> queue and packets belonging to SCP and SFTP
connections to the <tt>ssh_bulk</tt> queue. SSH login connections will
then have their packets processed ahead of SCP and SFTP connections
because the <tt>ssh_login</tt> queue has a higher priority.

<p>
Assigning TCP ACK packets to a higher priority queue is useful on
asymmetric connections, that is, connections that have different upload
and download bandwidths such as ADSL lines. With an ADSL line, if the
upload channel is being maxed out and a download is started, the
download will suffer because the TCP ACK packets it needs to
send will run into congestion when they try to pass through the upload
channel. Testing has shown that to achieve the best results, the
bandwidth on the upload queue should be set to a value less than what
the connection is capable of. For instance, if an ADSL line has a max
upload of 640Kbps, setting the root queue's <tt>bandwidth</tt> to a value
such as 600Kb should result in better performance. Trial and error will
yield the best <tt>bandwidth</tt> setting.

<p>
When using the <tt>queue</tt> keyword with rules that <tt>keep
state</tt> such as:
<blockquote>
<tt>
pass in on fxp0 proto tcp from any to any port 22 flags S/SA \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep state queue ssh
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
PF will record the queue in the state table entry so that packets
traveling back out <tt>fxp0</tt> that match the stateful connection will
end up in the <tt>ssh</tt> queue. Note that even though the <tt>queue</tt>
keyword is being used on a rule filtering incoming traffic, the goal is
to specify a queue for the corresponding outgoing traffic; the above
rule does not queue incoming packets.

<a name="example1"></a>
<h2>Example #1: Small, Home Network</h2>
<pre>
  
    [ Alice ]    [ Charlie ]
        |             |                              ADSL
     ---+-----+-------+------ dc0 [ OpenBSD ] fxp0 -------- ( Internet )
              |
           [ Bob ]

</pre>

<p>
In this example, OpenBSD is being used on an Internet gateway for a small
home network with three workstations. The gateway is performing packet
filtering and NAT duties. The Internet connection is via an ADSL line
running at 2Mbps down and 640Kbps up.

<p>
The queueing policy for this network:
<ul>
<li>Reserve 80Kbps of download bandwidth for Bob so he can play his
online games without being lagged by Alice or Charlie's downloads. Allow
Bob to use more than 80Kbps when it's available.
<li>Interactive SSH and instant message traffic will have a higher
priority than regular traffic.
<li>DNS queries and replies will have the second highest priority.
<li>Outgoing TCP ACK packets will have a higher priority than all other
outgoing traffic.
</ul>

<p>
Below is the ruleset that meets this network policy. Note that only the
<tt>pf.conf</tt> directives that apply directly to the above policy are
present; <a href="nat.html"><tt>nat</tt></a>,
<a href="rdr.html"><tt>rdr</tt></a>, <a href="options.html">options</a>,
etc., are not shown.

<p>
In this example, the OpenBSD host is acting as a firewall for a company
network. The company runs a WWW server in the DMZ portion of their
network where customers upload their websites via FTP. The IT department
has their own subnet connected to the main network, and the boss has a PC
on his desk that's used for email and surfing the web. The connection to
the Internet is via a T1 line running at 1.5Mbps in both directions. All
other network segments are using Fast Ethernet (100Mbps).

<p>
The network administrator has decided on the following policy:
<ul>
<li>Limit traffic between the WWW server and the Internet to 500Kbps in
each direction.
<li>No bandwidth limit on traffic between the WWW server and the
internal network.
<li>Give HTTP traffic between the WWW server and the Internet a higher
priority than other traffic between the WWW server and the Internet
(such as FTP uploads).
<li>Reserve 500Kbps for the IT Dept network so they can download the
latest software updates in a timely manner. They should be able to use
more than 500Kbps when extra bandwidth is available.
<li>Give traffic between the boss's PC and the Internet a higher
priority than other traffic to/from the Internet.
</ul>

<p>
Below is the ruleset that meets this network policy. Note that only the
<tt>pf.conf</tt> directives that apply directly to the above policy are
present; <a href="nat.html"><tt>nat</tt></a>,
<a href="rdr.html"><tt>rdr</tt></a>, <a href="options.html">options</a>,
