<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/authpf">authpf(8)</a> utility is a user
shell for authenticating gateways.
An authenticating gateway is just like a regular network gateway (also known
as a router) except that users must first authenticate themselves to it before
their traffic is allowed to pass through.
When a user's shell is set to <code>/usr/sbin/authpf</code> and they log in
using SSH, authpf will make the necessary changes to the active
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf">pf(4)</a> ruleset so that the user's
traffic is passed through the filter and/or translated using NAT/redirection.
Once the user logs out or their session is disconnected, authpf will remove
any rules loaded for the user and kill any stateful connections the user has
open.
Because of this, the ability of the user to pass traffic through the gateway
only exists while the user keeps their SSH session open.

<p>
A user's rules are loaded into a unique <a href="anchors.html">anchor</a>
point by authpf.
The anchor is named by combining the username and the authpf process-id
in the <code>username(PID)</code> format.
Each user's anchor is stored within the <code>authpf</code> anchor which is
in turn anchored to the main ruleset.
The fully qualified anchor path then becomes:

<pre class="cmdbox">
main_ruleset/authpf/username(PID)
</pre>

The rules that authpf loads can be configured on a per-user or global basis.

<p>
Example uses of authpf include:

<ul>
 <li>Requiring users to authenticate before allowing internet access.
 <li>Granting certain users -- such as administrators -- access to
     restricted parts of the network.
 <li>Allowing only known users to access the rest of the network or
     internet from a wireless network segment.
 <li>Allowing workers from home or on the road access to resources on the
     company network.
     Users outside the office can not only open access to the company network,
     but can also be redirected to particular resources (their own desktop,
     for example) based on the username they authenticate with.
 <li>In a setting such as a library or other place with public Internet
     terminals, PF may be configured to allow limited Internet access to
     guest users.
     Registered users can then be provided with complete access.
</ul>

The authpf tool logs the username and IP of each user who authenticates
successfully, as well as the start and end times of their login session via
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/syslogd">syslogd(8)</a>.
By using this information, an administrator can determine who was logged in
when and also make users accountable for their network traffic.

<h2 id="config">Configuration</h2>

The basic steps needed to configure authpf are outlined here.
For a complete description of authpf configuration, please refer to the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/authpf">man page</a>.

<h3 id="enable">Enabling authpf</h3>

The authpf utility will not run if the <code>/etc/authpf/authpf.conf</code>
config file is not present.
The file may be empty, but unless it is present, authpf will exit immediately
after a user authenticates successfully.

<p>
The following configuration directives can be placed in
<code>authpf.conf</code>:

<ul>
  <li><code>anchor=name</code> - Use the specified
      <a href="anchors.html">anchor</a> <code>name</code> instead of
      <code>authpf</code>
  <li><code>table=name</code> - Use the specified
      <a href="tables.html">table</a> <code>name</code> instead of
      <code>authpf_users</code>
</ul>

<h3 id="linkmain">Linking authpf into the Main Ruleset</h3>

You can link authpf into the main ruleset by using an <code>anchor</code> rule:

<pre class="cmdbox">
anchor "authpf/*"
</pre>

Wherever the <code>anchor</code> rule is placed within the ruleset is where PF
will branch off from the main ruleset to evaluate the authpf rules.

<h3 id="loadrules">Configuring Loaded Rules</h3>

The authpf rules can be loaded from one of these two files:

<ul>
 <li><code>/etc/authpf/users/$USER/authpf.rules</code>
 <li><code>/etc/authpf/authpf.rules</code>
</ul>

The first file contains rules that are only loaded when the user
<code>$USER</code> (which is replaced with the user's username) logs in.
The per-user rule configuration is used when a specific user, such as an
administrator, requires a set of rules that is different than the default set.
The second file contains the default rules which are loaded for any user that
doesn't have their own <code>authpf.rules</code> file.
If the user-specific file exists, it will override the default file.
At least one of the files must exist or authpf will not run.

<p>
Rules have the same syntax as in any other PF ruleset with one exception:
authpf allows for the use of two predefined macros:

<ul>
 <li><code>$user_ip</code> - the IP address of the logged in user
 <li><code>$user_id</code> - the username of the logged in user
</ul>

It's recommended practice to use the <code>$user_ip</code> macro to only permit
traffic through the gateway from the authenticated user's computer.

<p>
In addition to the <code>$user_ip</code> macro, authpf will make use of the
<code>authpf_users</code> table (if it exists) for storing the IP addresses
of all authenticated users.
Be sure to define the table before using it:

<pre class="cmdbox">
table &lt;authpf_users&gt; persist
pass in on egress proto tcp from &lt;authpf_users&gt; to port smtp
</pre>

This table should only be used in rules that are meant to apply to all
authenticated users.

<h3 id="acl">Access Control Lists</h3>

Users can be prevented from using authpf by creating a file in the
<code>/etc/authpf/banned/</code> directory and naming it after their username.
The contents of the file will be displayed to the user before authpf
disconnects them.
This provides a handy way to notify the user of why they're disallowed access
and who to contact to have their access restored.

<p>
Conversely, it's also possible to allow only specific users access by
placing usernames in the <code>/etc/authpf/authpf.allow</code> file.
If the <code>/etc/authpf/authpf.allow</code> file does not exist or
"<code>*</code>"
is entered into the file, then authpf will permit access to any user who
successfully logs in via SSH as long as they are not explicitly banned.

<p>
If authpf is unable to determine if a username is allowed or denied, it
will print a brief message and then disconnect the user.
An entry in <code>/etc/authpf/banned/</code> always overrides an entry in
<code>/etc/authpf/authpf.allow</code>.

<h3 id="message">Displaying a Login Message</h3>

Whenever a user successfully authenticates to authpf, a greeting is printed
which indicates that the user is authenticated.

<pre class="cmdbox">
Hello charlie. You are authenticated from host "198.51.100.10"
</pre>

This message can be supplemented by putting a custom message in
<code>/etc/authpf/authpf.message</code>.
The contents of this file will be displayed after the default welcome message.

<h3 id="shell">Assigning authpf as a User's Shell</h3>

In order for authpf to work, it must be assigned as the user's login shell.
When the user successfully authenticates to
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd">sshd(8)</a>, authpf will be executed
as the user's shell.
It will then check if the user is allowed to use authpf, load the rules from
the appropriate file, etc.

<p>
There are a couple ways of assigning authpf as a user's shell:

<ol>
  <li>Manually for each user using
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/chsh">chsh(1)</a>,
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vipw">vipw(8)</a>,
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/useradd">useradd(8)</a>,
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/usermod">usermod(8)</a>, etc.
  <li>By assigning users to a login class and changing the class's
      <code>shell</code> option in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/login.conf">login.conf(5)</a>.
</ol>

<h2 id="loginclass">Creating an authpf Login Class</h2>

When using authpf on a system that has regular user accounts and authpf
user accounts, it can be beneficial to use a separate login class for
the authpf users.
This allows for certain changes to those accounts to be made on a global
basis, and also allows different policies to be placed on regular accounts
and authpf accounts.
Some examples of what policies can be set:

<ul>
 <li><b>shell</b> - Specify a user's login shell.
     This can be used to force a user's shell to <code>authpf</code> regardless
     of the entry in the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/passwd">passwd(5)</a>
     database.
 <li><b>welcome</b> - Specify which
     <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/motd">motd(5)</a> file to display when
     a user logs in.
     This is useful for displaying messages that are relevant only to authpf
     users.
</ul>

<p>
Login classes are created in the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/login.conf">login.conf(5)</a> file.
OpenBSD comes with an authpf login class defined as:

<pre class="cmdbox">
authpf:\
    :welcome=/etc/motd.authpf:\
    :shell=/usr/sbin/authpf:\
    :tc=default:
</pre>

Users are assigned to a login class by editing the <code>class</code> field
of the user's passwd(5) database entry.
One way to do this is with the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/chsh">chsh(1)</a> command.

<h2 id="wholog">Seeing Who is Logged In</h2>

Once a user has successfully logged in and authpf has adjusted the PF
rules, authpf changes its process title to indicate the username and IP
address of the logged in user:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>ps -ax | grep authpf</b>
23664 p0  Is+     0:00.11 -authpf: charlie@192.168.1.3 (authpf)
</pre>

Here the user <code>charlie</code> is logged in from the machine 192.168.1.3.
By sending a SIGTERM signal to the authpf process, the user can be forcefully
logged out.
Any rules loaded for the user will be removed and any stateful connections
the user has open will be killed.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>kill -TERM 23664</b>
</pre>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

The authpf tool is being used on an OpenBSD gateway to authenticate users on
a wireless network which is part of a larger campus network.
Once a user has authenticated, assuming they're not on the banned list, they
will be permitted to SSH out and to browse the web (including secure websites)
in addition to accessing either of the campus DNS servers.

<p>
The <code>/etc/authpf/authpf.rules</code> file contains the following rules:

<pre class="cmdbox">
wifi_if = "wi0"

pass in quick on $wifi_if \
   proto tcp from $user_ip to any port { ssh, http, https }
</pre>

The administrative user <code>charlie</code> needs to be able to access the
campus SMTP and POP3 servers in addition to surfing the web and using SSH.
The following rules are set up in
<code>/etc/authpf/users/charlie/authpf.rules</code>:

<pre class="cmdbox">
wifi_if = "wi0"
smtp_server = "10.0.1.50"
pop3_server = "10.0.1.51"

pass in quick on $wifi_if \
   proto tcp from $user_ip to $smtp_server port smtp
pass in quick on $wifi_if \
   proto tcp from $user_ip to $pop3_server port pop3
pass in quick on $wifi_if \
   proto tcp from $user_ip to port { ssh, http, https }
</pre>

The main ruleset -- located in <code>/etc/pf.conf</code> -- is set up as
follows:

<pre class="cmdbox">
wifi_if = "wi0"
ext_if  = "fxp0"
dns_servers = "{ 10.0.1.56, 10.0.2.56 }"

table &lt;authpf_users&gt; persist

block drop all

pass out quick on $ext_if \
   inet proto { tcp, udp, icmp } from { $wifi_if:network, $ext_if }

pass in quick on $wifi_if \
   inet proto tcp from $wifi_if:network to $wifi_if port ssh

pass in quick on $wifi_if \
   inet proto { tcp, udp } from &lt;authpf_users&gt; to $dns_servers port domain

anchor "authpf/*" in on $wifi_if
</pre>

The ruleset is very simple and does the following:

<ul>
  <li>Block everything (default deny).
  <li>Pass outgoing TCP, UDP and ICMP traffic on the external interface
      from the wireless network and from the gateway itself.
  <li>Pass incoming SSH traffic from the wireless network destined for the
      gateway itself.
      This rule is necessary to permit users to log in.
  <li>Pass incoming DNS requests from all authenticated authpf users to
      the campus DNS servers.
  <li>Create the anchor point "authpf" for incoming traffic on the wireless
      interface.
</ul>

The idea behind the main ruleset is to block everything and allow the
least amount of traffic through as possible.
Traffic is free to flow out on the external interface but is blocked from
entering the wireless interface by the default deny policy.
Once a user authenticates, their traffic is permitted to pass in on the
wireless interface and to then flow through the gateway into the rest of
the network.
The <code>quick</code> keyword is used throughout so that PF doesn't have to
evaluate each named ruleset when a new connection passes through the gateway.
