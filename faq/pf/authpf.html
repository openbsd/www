<h2>Introduction</h2>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=authpf&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.6"
>Authpf(8)</a> is a user shell for authenticating gateways. An
authenticating gateway is just like a regular network gateway (a.k.a. a
router) except that users must first authenticate themselves to the
gateway before it will allow traffic to pass through it. When a user's
shell is set to <tt>/usr/sbin/authpf</tt> (i.e., instead of setting a
user's shell to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ksh&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.6"
>ksh(1)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=csh&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.6"
>csh(1)</a>, etc) and the user logs in using SSH, authpf will make the
necessary changes to the active  
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf&amp;sektion=4&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.6"
>pf(4)</a> ruleset so that the user's traffic is passed through the
filter and/or translated using Network Address Translation or
redirection. Once the user logs out or their session is disconnected,
authpf will remove any rules loaded for the user and kill any stateful
connections the user has open. Because of this, the ability of the user
to pass traffic through the gateway only exists while the user keeps
their SSH session open. 

<p>
Authpf loads a user's filter/NAT rules into a unique
<a href="anchors.html">anchor point</a>. 
The anchor is named by combining the user's UNIX username and the authpf
process-id into the format "<tt>username(PID)</tt>".
Each users' anchor is stored within the <tt>authpf</tt> anchor which is
in turn anchored to the main ruleset.
The "fully qualified anchor path" then becomes:

<blockquote>
<tt>
<i>main_ruleset</i>/authpf/<i>username</i>(<i>PID</i>)
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
The rules that authpf loads can be configured on a per-user or global
basis.

<p>
Example uses of authpf include:
<ul>
<li>Requiring users to authenticate before allowing Internet access.
<li>Granting certain users -- such as administrators -- access to
restricted parts of the network.
<li>Allowing only known users to access the rest of the network or
Internet from a wireless network segment.
<li>Allowing workers from home, on the road, etc., access to resources on
the company network.  Users outside the office can not only open access
to the company network, but can also be redirected to particular
resources (e.g., their own desktop) based on the username they
authenticate with.
<li>In a setting such as a library or other place with public Internet
terminals, PF may be configured to allow limited Internet access to
guest users. Authpf can then be used to provide registered users with
complete access.
</ul>

<p>
Authpf logs the username and IP address of each user who authenticates
successfully as well as the start and end times of their login session
via
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=syslogd&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.6"
>syslogd(8)</a>. By using this information, an administrator can
determine who was logged in when and also make users accountable for
their network traffic.

<a name="config"></a>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
The basic steps needed to configure authpf are outlined here. For a
complete description of authpf configuration, please refer to the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=authpf&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.6"
>authpf man page</a>.

<a name="enable"></a>
<h3>Enabling Authpf</h3>

<p>
Authpf will not run if the config file <tt>/etc/authpf/authpf.conf</tt>
is not present.
Even if the file is empty (zero size), it must still be present or
authpf will exit immediately after a user authenticates successfully.

<p>
The following configuration directives can be placed in
<tt>authpf.conf</tt>:

<ul>
<li><tt>anchor=<i>name</i></tt> - Use the specified
<a href="anchors.html">anchor</a> name instead of "authpf".
<li><tt>table=<i>name</i></tt> - Use the specified 
<a href="tables.html">table</a> name instead of "authpf_users".
</ul>

<a name="linkmain"></a>
<h3>Linking Authpf into the Main Ruleset</h3>
Authpf is linked into the main ruleset by using <tt>anchor</tt> rules:
<blockquote>
<tt>
nat-anchor "authpf/*"<br>
rdr-anchor "authpf/*"<br>
binat-anchor "authpf/*"<br>
anchor "authpf/*"<br>
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Wherever the <tt>anchor</tt> rules are placed within the ruleset is
where PF will branch off from the main ruleset to evaluate the authpf
rules. It's not necessary for all four <tt>anchor</tt> rules to be
present; for example, if authpf hasn't been setup to load any
<tt>nat</tt> rules, the <tt>nat-anchor</tt> rule can be omitted.

<a name="loadrules"></a>
<h3>Configuring Loaded Rules</h3>
Authpf loads its rules from one of two files:
<ul>
<li><tt>/etc/authpf/users/$USER/authpf.rules</tt>
<li><tt>/etc/authpf/authpf.rules</tt>
</ul>

<p>
The first file contains rules that are only loaded when the user
<tt>$USER</tt> (which is replaced with the user's username) logs in. The
per-user rule configuration is used when a specific user -- such as an
administrator -- requires a set of rules that is different than the
default set.  The second file contains the default rules which are
loaded for any user that doesn't have their own <tt>authpf.rules</tt>
file. If the user-specific file exists, it will override the default
file. At least one of the files must exist or authpf will not run. 

<p>
Filter and translation rules have the same syntax as in any other PF
ruleset with one exception: Authpf allows for the use of two predefined
macros:
<ul>
<li><tt>$user_ip</tt> - the IP address of the logged in user
<li><tt>$user_id</tt> - the username of the logged in user
</ul>

<p>
It's recommended practice to use the <tt>$user_ip</tt> macro to only
permit traffic through the gateway from the authenticated user's
computer.

<p>
In addition to the <tt>$user_ip</tt> macro, authpf will make use of the
<tt>authpf_users</tt> table (if it exists) for storing the IP addresses
of all authenticated users.
Be sure to define the table before using it:

<blockquote>
<tt>
table &lt;authpf_users&gt; persist<br>
pass in on $ext_if proto tcp from &lt;authpf_users&gt; \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to port  smtp flags S/SA keep state
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
This table should only be used in rules that are meant to apply to all
authenticated users.

<a name="acl"></a>
<h3>Access Control Lists</h3>
Users can be prevented from using authpf by creating a file in the
<tt>/etc/authpf/banned/</tt> directory and naming it after the username
that is to be denied access.  The contents of the file will be displayed
to the user before authpf disconnects them. This provides a handy way to
notify the user of why they're disallowed access and who to contact to
have their access restored.

<p>
Conversely, it's also possible to allow only specific users access by
placing usernames in the <tt>/etc/authpf/authpf.allow</tt> file.  If the
<tt>/etc/authpf/authpf.allow</tt> file does not exist or "<tt>*</tt>" is
entered into the file, then authpf will permit access to any user who
successfully logs in via SSH as long as they are not explicitly banned.

<p>
If authpf is unable to determine if a username is allowed or denied, it
will print a brief message and then disconnect the user. An entry in
<tt>/etc/authpf/banned/</tt> always overrides an entry in
<tt>/etc/authpf/authpf.allow</tt>.

<a name="message"></a>
<h3>Displaying a Login Message</h3>

<p>
Whenever a user successfully authenticates to authpf, a greeting is
printed that indicates that the user is authenticated.

<blockquote>
<tt>
Hello charlie. You are authenticated from host "64.59.56.140"
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
This message can be supplemented by putting a custom message in
<tt>/etc/authpf/authpf.message</tt>. 
The contents of this file will be displayed after the default welcome
message.

<a name="shell"></a>
<h3>Assigning Authpf as a User's Shell</h3>
In order for authpf to work it must be assigned as the user's login
shell. When the user successfully authenticates to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.6"
>sshd(8)</a>, authpf will be executed as the user's shell. It will then
check if the user is allowed to use authpf, load the rules from the
appropriate file, etc.

<p>
There are a couple ways of assigning authpf as a user's shell:
<ol>
<li>Manually for each user using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=chsh&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.6"
>chsh(1)</a>, 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vipw&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.6"
>vipw(8)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=useradd&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.6"
>useradd(8)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=usermod&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.6"
>usermod(8)</a>, etc.
<li>By assigning users to a login class and changing the class's 
<tt>shell</tt> option in
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=login.conf&amp;sektion=5&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.6"
><tt>/etc/login.conf</tt></a>.
</ol>

<a name="loginclass"></a>
<h2>Creating an authpf Login Class</h2>
When using authpf on a system that has regular user accounts and authpf
user accounts, it can be beneficial to create a separate login class for
the authpf users.
This allows for certain changes to those accounts to be made on a global
basis and also allows different policies to be placed on regular
accounts and authpf accounts.
Some examples of what policies can be set:

<ul>
<li><b>shell</b> - Specify a user's login shell.
This can be used to force a user's shell to <tt>authpf</tt> regardless
of the entry in the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=passwd&amp;sektion=5"
>passwd(5)</a> database. 
<li><b>welcome</b> - Specify which
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=motd&amp;sektion=5"
>motd(5)</a> file to display when a user logs in. 
This is useful for displaying messages that are relevant only to authpf
users.
</ul>

<p>
Login classes are created in the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=login.conf&amp;sektion=5"
>login.conf(5)</a> file. 
An example login class for authpf users:

<blockquote>
<tt>
authpf:\<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:welcome=/etc/motd.authpf:\<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:shell=/usr/sbin/authpf:\<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:tc=default:
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Users are assigned to a login class by editing the <tt>class</tt> field
of the user's passwd(5) database entry.
One way to do this is with the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=chsh&amp;sektion=1"
>chsh(1)</a> command.


<a name="wholog"></a>
<h2>Seeing Who is Logged In</h2>
Once a user has successfully logged in and authpf has adjusted the PF
rules, authpf changes its process title to indicate the username and IP
address of the logged in user:
<pre>
    # ps -ax | grep authpf
    23664 p0  Is+     0:00.11 -authpf: charlie@192.168.1.3 (authpf)
</pre>

<p>
Here the user <tt>charlie</tt> is logged in from the machine
192.168.1.3.  By sending a SIGTERM signal to the authpf process, the
user can be forcefully logged out. Authpf will also remove any rules
loaded for the user and kill any stateful connections the user has open.
<pre>
    # kill -TERM 23664
</pre>

<a name="example"></a>
<h2>Example</h2>
Authpf is being used on an OpenBSD gateway to authenticate users on a
wireless network which is part of a larger campus network. Once a user
has authenticated, assuming they're not on the banned list, they will be
permitted to SSH out and to browse the web (including secure web sites)
in addition to accessing either of the campus DNS servers.

<p>
The <tt>/etc/authpf/authpf.rules</tt> file contains the following rules:<br>
<br>

<table border=0 width="650">
<tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<pre>
wifi_if = "wi0"

pass in quick on $wifi_if proto tcp from $user_ip to port { ssh, http, \
   https } flags S/SA keep state
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The administrative user <tt>charlie</tt> needs to be able to access the
campus SMTP and POP3 servers in addition to surfing the web and using
SSH. The following rules are setup in
<tt>/etc/authpf/users/charlie/authpf.rules</tt>:<br>
<br>

<table border=0 width="650">
<tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<pre>
wifi_if = "wi0"
smtp_server = "10.0.1.50"
pop3_server = "10.0.1.51"

pass in quick on $wifi_if proto tcp from $user_ip to $smtp_server \
   port smtp flags S/SA keep state
pass in quick on $wifi_if proto tcp from $user_ip to $pop3_server \
   port pop3 flags S/SA keep state
pass in quick on $wifi_if proto tcp from $user_ip to port { ssh, http, \
   https } flags S/SA keep state
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The main ruleset -- located in <tt>/etc/pf.conf</tt> -- is setup
as follows:<br>
<br>

<table border=0 width="650">
<tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<pre>
# macros
wifi_if = "wi0"
ext_if  = "fxp0"
dns_servers = "{ 10.0.1.56, 10.0.2.56 }"

table &lt;authpf_users&gt; persist

scrub in all

# filter
block drop all

pass out quick on $ext_if inet proto tcp from \
   { $wifi_if:network, $ext_if } flags S/SA modulate state
pass out quick on $ext_if inet proto { udp, icmp } from \
   { $wifi_if:network, $ext_if } keep state

pass in quick on $wifi_if inet proto tcp from $wifi_if:network to $wifi_if \
   port ssh flags S/SA keep state

pass in quick on $wifi_if inet proto { tcp, udp } from &lt;authpf_users&gt; \
   to $dns_servers port domain keep state
anchor "authpf/*" in on $wifi_if
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The ruleset is very simple and does the following:
<ul>
<li>Block everything (default deny).
<li>Pass outgoing TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic on the external interface 
from the wireless network and from the gateway itself.
<li>Pass incoming SSH traffic from the wireless network destined for the
gateway itself. This rule is necessary to permit users to log in.
<li>Pass incoming DNS requests from all authenticated authpf users to
the campus DNS servers.
<li>Create the anchor point "authpf" for incoming traffic on the wireless
interface. 
</ul>

<p>
The idea behind the main ruleset is to block everything and allow the
least amount of traffic through as possible. Traffic is free to flow out
on the external interface but is blocked from entering the wireless
interface by the default deny policy. Once a user authenticates,
their traffic is permitted to pass in on the wireless interface
and to then flow through the gateway into the rest of the network. The
<tt>quick</tt> keyword is used throughout so that PF doesn't have to
evaluate each named ruleset when a new connection passes through the
gateway.
