<h2>Introduction</h2>
Packet tagging is a way of marking packets with an internal identifier
that can later be used in filter and translation rule criteria. 
With tagging, it's possible to do such things as create "trusts" between
interfaces and determine if packets have been processed by translation
rules. 
It's also possible to move away from rule-based filtering and to start
doing policy-based filtering.

<a name="assign"></a>
<h2>Assigning Tags to Packets</h2>
To add a tag to a packet, use the <tt>tag</tt> keyword:
<blockquote>
<tt>
pass in on $int_if all tag INTERNAL_NET keep state
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
The tag <tt>INTERNAL_NET</tt> will be added to any packet which matches
the above rule. Note the use of <tt>keep state</tt>; <tt>keep state</tt>
(or <tt>modulate state</tt>/<tt>synproxy state</tt>) must be used in
<tt>pass</tt> rules that tag packets.

<p>
Tagging follows these rules:
<ul>
<li>Tags are "sticky". Once a tag is applied to a packet by a matching
rule it is never removed. It can, however, be replaced with a different
tag.
<li>Because of a tag's "stickiness", a packet can have a tag even if the
last matching rule doesn't use the <tt>tag</tt> keyword.
<li>A packet is only ever assigned a maximum of one tag at a time.
<li>Tags are <i>internal</i> identifiers. Tags are not sent out over the
wire.
</ul>

<p>
Take the following ruleset as an example.
<blockquote>
<tt>
(1) pass in on $int_if tag INT_NET keep state<br>
(2) pass in quick on $int_if proto tcp to port 80 tag \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INT_NET_HTTP keep state<br>
(3) pass in quick on $int_if from 192.168.1.5 keep state
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Packets coming in on <tt>$int_if</tt> will be assigned a tag of
<tt>INT_NET</tt> by rule #1.
<li>TCP packets coming in on <tt>$int_if</tt> and destined for port 80
will first be assigned a tag of <tt>INT_NET</tt> by rule #1. That tag
will then be replaced with the <tt>INT_NET_HTTP</tt> tag by rule #2.
<li>Packets coming in on <tt>$int_if</tt> from 192.168.1.5 will be
passed by rule #3 since it's the last matching rule. 
However, those packets will be tagged with the <tt>INT_NET_HTTP</tt> tag
if they were destined for TCP port 80, otherwise they'll be tagged with
the <tt>INT_NET</tt> tag.
</ul>

<p>
In addition to applying tags with filter rules, the <tt>nat</tt>,
<tt>rdr</tt>, and <tt>binat</tt> translation rules can also apply tags
to packets by using the <tt>tag</tt> keyword.

<a name="check"></a>
<h2>Checking for Applied Tags</h2>
To check for previously applied tags, use the <tt>tagged</tt> keyword:
<blockquote>
<tt>
pass out on $ext_if tagged INT_NET keep state
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Outgoing packets on <tt>$ext_if</tt> must be tagged with the
<tt>INT_NET</tt> tag in order to match the above rule. Inverse matching
can also be done by using the <tt>!</tt> operator:
<blockquote>
<tt>
pass out on $ext_if tagged ! WIFI_NET keep state
</tt>
</blockquote>

<a name="policy"></a>
<h2>Policy Filtering</h2>
Policy filtering takes a different approach to writing a filter ruleset.
A policy is defined which sets the rules for what types of traffic is
passed and what types are blocked. 
Packets are then classified into the policy based on the traditional
criteria of source/destination IP address/port, protocol, etc. 
For example, examine the following firewall policy:
<ul>
<li>Traffic from the internal LAN to the DMZ is permitted (LAN_DMZ)
<li>Traffic from the Internet to servers in the DMZ is permitted
(INET_DMZ)
<li>Traffic from the Internet that's being redirected to 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=spamd&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>spamd(8)</a> is permitted (SPAMD)
<li>All other traffic is blocked
</ul>

<p>
Note how the policy covers <i>all</i> traffic that will be passing through
the firewall. 
The item in parenthesis indicates the tag that will be used for that
policy item.

<p>
Filter and translation rules now need to be written to classify packets
into the policy.
<blockquote>
<tt>
rdr on $ext_if proto tcp from &lt;spamd&gt; to port smtp \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tag SPAMD -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 8025<br>
<br>
block all<br>
pass in on $int_if from $int_net tag LAN_INET keep state<br>
pass in on $int_if from $int_net to $dmz_net tag LAN_DMZ keep state<br>
pass in on $ext_if proto tcp to $www_server port 80 tag INET_DMZ keep state
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now the rules that define the policy are set.
<blockquote>
<tt>
pass in &nbsp;quick on $ext_if tagged SPAMD keep state<br>
pass out quick on $ext_if tagged LAN_INET keep state<br>
pass out quick on $dmz_if tagged LAN_DMZ keep state<br>
pass out quick on $dmz_if tagged INET_DMZ keep state
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now that the whole ruleset is setup, changes are a matter of modifying
the classification rules.
For example, if a POP3/SMTP server is added to the DMZ, it will be
necessary to add classification rules for POP3 and SMTP traffic, like
so:
<blockquote>
<tt>
mail_server = "192.168.0.10"<br>
...<br>
pass in on $ext_if proto tcp to $mail_server port { smtp, pop3 } \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tag INET_DMZ keep state
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Email traffic will now be passed as part of the INET_DMZ policy entry.

<p>
The complete ruleset:
<table border=0 width="650">
<tr><td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<pre>
# macros
int_if  = "dc0"
dmz_if  = "dc1"
ext_if  = "ep0"
int_net = "10.0.0.0/24"
dmz_net = "192.168.0.0/24"
www_server = "192.168.0.5"
mail_server = "192.168.0.10"

table &lt;spamd&gt; persist file "/etc/spammers"

# classification -- classify packets based on the defined firewall
# policy.
rdr on $ext_if proto tcp from &lt;spamd&gt; to port smtp \
    tag SPAMD -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 8025

block all
pass in on $int_if from $int_net tag LAN_INET keep state
pass in on $int_if from $int_net to $dmz_net tag LAN_DMZ keep state
pass in on $ext_if proto tcp to $www_server port 80 tag INET_DMZ keep state 
pass in on $ext_if proto tcp to $mail_server port { smtp, pop3 } \
    tag INET_DMZ keep state 

# policy enforcement -- pass/block based on the defined firewall policy.
pass in  quick on $ext_if tagged SPAMD keep state
pass out quick on $ext_if tagged LAN_INET keep state
pass out quick on $dmz_if tagged LAN_DMZ keep state
pass out quick on $dmz_if tagged INET_DMZ keep state 
</pre>
</td></tr>

<h2>Tagging Ethernet Frames</h2>
Tagging can be performed at the Ethernet level if the machine doing the
tagging/filtering is also acting as a 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=bridge&amp;sektion=4&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>bridge(4)</a>. 
By creating bridge(4) filter rules that use the <tt>tag</tt> keyword, PF
can be made to filter based on the source/destination MAC address.
Bridge(4) rules are created using the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=brconfig&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>brconfig(8)</a> command. Example:
<blockquote>
<tt>
# brconfig bridge0 rule pass in on fxp0 src 0:de:ad:be:ef:0 \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tag USER1
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
And then in <tt>pf.conf</tt>:
<blockquote>
<tt>
pass in on fxp0 tagged USER1
</tt>
</blockquote>
