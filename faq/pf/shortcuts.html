<h2>Introduction</h2>
PF offers many ways in which a ruleset can be simplified. Some good
examples are by using
<a href="macros.html#macros">macros</a> and
<a href="macros.html#lists">lists</a>.
In addition, the ruleset language, or grammar, also offers some
shortcuts for making a ruleset simpler.  As a general rule of thumb, the
simpler a ruleset is, the easier it is to understand and to maintain.

<a name="macros"></a>
<h2>Using Macros</h2>
Macros are useful because they provide an alternative to hard-coding
addresses, port numbers, interfaces names, etc., into a ruleset. Did a
server's IP address change? No problem, just update the macro; no need
to mess around with the filter rules that you've spent time and energy
perfecting for your needs.

<p>
A common convention in PF rulesets is to define a macro for each
network interface. If a network card ever needs to be replaced with one
that uses a different driver, for example swapping out a 3Com for an
Intel, the macro can be updated and the filter rules will function as
before. Another benefit is when installing the same ruleset on multiple
machines. Certain machines may have different network cards in them,
and using macros to define the network interfaces allows the rulesets to
be installed with minimal editing. Using macros to define information in
a ruleset that is subject to change, such as port numbers, IP addresses,
and interface names, is recommended practice.
<blockquote>
<tt>
# define macros for each network interface<br>
IntIF = "dc0"<br>
ExtIF = "fxp0"<br>
DmzIF = "fxp1"
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another common convention is using macros to define IP addresses and 
network blocks. This can greatly reduce the maintenance of a ruleset
when IP addresses change.
<blockquote>
<tt>
# define our networks<br>
IntNet = "192.168.0.0/24"<br>
ExtAdd = "24.65.13.4"<br>
DmzNet = "10.0.0.0/24"
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the internal network ever expanded or was renumbered into a different
IP block, the macro can be updated:
<blockquote>
<tt>
IntNet = "{ 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24 }"
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Once the ruleset is reloaded, everything will work as before.

<a name="lists"></a>
<h2>Using Lists</h2>
Let's look at a good set of rules to have in your ruleset to handle
<a href="http://www.geektools.com/rfc/rfc1918.txt">RFC 1918</a>
addresses that just shouldn't be floating around the Internet,
and when they are, are usually trying to cause trouble:
<blockquote>
<tt>
block in &nbsp;quick on tl0 inet from 127.0.0.0/8 to any<br>
block in &nbsp;quick on tl0 inet from 192.168.0.0/16 to any<br>
block in &nbsp;quick on tl0 inet from 172.16.0.0/12 to any<br>
block in &nbsp;quick on tl0 inet from 10.0.0.0/8 to any<br>
block out quick on tl0 inet from any to 127.0.0.0/8<br>
block out quick on tl0 inet from any to 192.168.0.0/16<br>
block out quick on tl0 inet from any to 172.16.0.0/12<br>
block out quick on tl0 inet from any to 10.0.0.0/8
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now look at the following simplification:
<blockquote>
<tt>
block in &nbsp;quick on tl0 inet from { 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8 } to any<br>
block out quick on tl0 inet from any to { 127.0.0.0/8, \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, 10.0.0.0/8 }
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
The ruleset has been reduced from eight lines down to two.
Things get even better when macros are used in conjunction with 
a list:
<blockquote>
<tt>
NoRouteIPs = "{ 127.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.0.0.0/8 }"
<br>
ExtIF = "tl0"<br>
block in &nbsp;quick on $ExtIF from $NoRouteIPs to any<br>
block out quick on $ExtIF from any to $NoRouteIPs
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that macros and lists simplify the <tt>pf.conf</tt> file, but
the lines are actually expanded by 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pfctl&amp;sektion=8&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>pfctl(8)</a> into multiple rules.  So, the above example actually
expands to the following rules:
<blockquote>
<tt>
block in &nbsp;quick on tl0 inet from 127.0.0.0/8 to any<br>
block in &nbsp;quick on tl0 inet from 192.168.0.0/16 to any<br>
block in &nbsp;quick on tl0 inet from 172.16.0.0/12 to any<br>
block in &nbsp;quick on tl0 inet from 10.0.0.0/8 to any<br>
block out quick on tl0 inet from any to 10.0.0.0/8<br>
block out quick on tl0 inet from any to 172.16.0.0/12<br>
block out quick on tl0 inet from any to 192.168.0.0/16<br>
block out quick on tl0 inet from any to 127.0.0.0/8
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
As you can see, the PF expansion is purely a convenience for the writer
and maintainer of the <tt>pf.conf</tt> file, not an actual
simplification of the rules processed by 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf&amp;sektion=4&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+3.4"
>pf(4)</a>.

<p>
Macros can be used to define more than just addresses and ports; they
can be used anywhere in a PF rules file:
<blockquote>
<tt>
pre  = "pass in quick on ep0 inet proto tcp from "<br>
post = "to any port { 80, 6667 } keep state"<br>
<br>
# David's classroom<br>
$pre 21.14.24.80 $post<br>
<br>
# Nick's home<br>
$pre 24.2.74.79 $post<br>
$pre 24.2.74.178 $post
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Expands to:
<blockquote>
<tt>
pass in quick on ep0 inet proto tcp from 21.14.24.80 to any \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;port = 80 keep state<br>
pass in quick on ep0 inet proto tcp from 21.14.24.80 to any \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;port = 6667 keep state<br>
pass in quick on ep0 inet proto tcp from 24.2.74.79 to any \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;port = 80 keep state<br>
pass in quick on ep0 inet proto tcp from 24.2.74.79 to any \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;port = 6667 keep state<br>
pass in quick on ep0 inet proto tcp from 24.2.74.178 to any \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;port = 80 keep state<br>
pass in quick on ep0 inet proto tcp from 24.2.74.178 to any \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;port = 6667 keep state
</tt>
</blockquote>

<a name="grammar"></a>
<h2>PF Grammar</h2>
Packet Filter's grammar is quite flexible which, in turn, allows
for great flexibility in a ruleset. PF is able to infer certain
keywords which means that they don't have to be explicitly stated in a
rule, and keyword ordering is relaxed such that it isn't necessary to
memorize strict syntax.

<a name="elim"></a>
<h3>Elimination of Keywords</h3>
<p>
To define a "default deny" policy, two rules are used:
<blockquote>
<tt>
block in &nbsp;all<br>
block out all
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
This can now be reduced to:
<blockquote>
<tt>
block all
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
When no direction is specified, PF will assume the rule applies to
packets moving in both directions.

<p>
Similarly, the "<tt>from any to any</tt>" and "<tt>all</tt>" clauses can
be left out of a rule, for example:
<blockquote>
<tt>
block in on rl0 all<br>
pass &nbsp;in quick log on rl0 proto tcp from any to any port 22 keep state
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
can be simplified as:
<blockquote>
<tt>
block in on rl0<br>
pass &nbsp;in quick log on rl0 proto tcp to port 22 keep state</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
The first rule blocks all incoming packets from anywhere to anywhere on
rl0, and the second rule passes in TCP traffic on rl0 to port 22.

<a name="return"></a>
<h3><tt>Return</tt> Simplification</h3>
<p>
A ruleset used to block packets and reply with a TCP RST or ICMP
Unreachable response could look like this:
<blockquote>
<tt>
block in all<br>
block return-rst in proto tcp all<br>
block return-icmp in proto udp all<br>
block out all<br>
block return-rst out proto tcp all<br>
block return-icmp out proto udp all
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
This can be simplified as:
<blockquote>
<tt>
block return
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
When PF sees the <tt>return</tt> keyword, it's smart enough to send the
proper response, or no response at all, depending on the protocol of the
packet being blocked.

<a name="order"></a>
<h3>Keyword Ordering</h3>
<p>
The order in which keywords are specified is flexible in most cases. For
example, a rule written as:
<blockquote>
<tt>
pass in log quick on rl0 proto tcp to port 22 \<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flags S/SA keep state queue ssh label ssh
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Can also be written as:
<blockquote>
<tt>
pass in quick log on rl0 proto tcp to port 22 \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;queue ssh keep state label ssh flags S/SA
</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Other, similar variations will also work.
