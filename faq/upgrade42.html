<i>Note: Upgrades are only supported from one release to the release
immediately following it.
Do not skip releases.</i>

<p><i>
It is highly recommended that you read through and fully understand
this process before attempting it.
If you are doing it on a critical or physically remote machine, it is
recommended that you test this process on an identical, local system to
verify its success before attempting on a critical or remote computer.
</i>

<p>
Upgrading is a convenient way to bring your OpenBSD system up to the most
recent version.
However, the results are not intended to precisely match the results of
a wipe-and-reload installation.
Old library files in particular are not removed in the upgrade process,
as they may be required by older applications that may or may not be
upgraded at this time.
If you REALLY wish to get rid of all these old files, you are probably
better off reinstalling from scratch.

<h2 id="before">Before upgrading: things to think about and be aware of</h2>

This is <i>not</i> a complete list of the changes that took place
between 4.1 and 4.2, but rather some of the important things that will
impact a large number of users in the upgrade process.
For a more complete list of changes, see
<a href="../plus42.html">plus42.html</a> and the CVS change logs.


<ul>
<li id="libexpat"><b>Packages are now using libexpat shipped with X;
xbase42.tgz is your friend:</b><br>
The libexpat port has been removed.
Packages now use the libexpat which is shipped with X instead.
Many packages depend on libexpat through other dependencies.
For instance, many packages require gettext which depends on
libexpat. Therefore, these packages also depend on libexpat.

<p>
This means that many systems that weren't using X before will now need to
have <tt>xbase42.tgz</tt> installed.
If you don't do this and try to install a package that requires libexpat,
pkg_add(1) will give an error message.

<p>
Also note that building ports is only supported with a full installation,
including <i>all</i> X file sets.

<p>
Finally, after upgrading all your packages to the 4.2 versions, clean up
by removing the old expat package from your system:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>pkg_delete expat</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<i>This will impact a large number of users!</i>
This was an unfortunate decision whose ramifications were not recognized
earlier in the process.
For 4.3, libexpat will be part of <tt>base43.tgz</tt>, solving this
problem.

<p>
<li id="X7.2XF3"><b>Enter X.org v7.2, exit XF3:</b><br>
A new version of X is in OpenBSD 4.2.
Your old X configuration may need to be adjusted, but many people will
find they don't need an X configuration file at all anymore.

<p>
As OpenBSD adapts to the newest versions of X.org, support for
XF3 on the i386 platform (the only platform it was used on still)
has been dropped.
XF3 was needed only for some very old video chips which were not
supported by XF4 and X.org.
It is not believed this will impact many people.

<p>
The new X.org version changes a lot of config files, so there is a
<a href="#Xup">separate section</a> to this upgrade process for X users.

<p>
<li id="ahci"><b>Updated
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ahci.4">ahci</a>
driver may change how disks are handled:</b><br>
Systems using the ahci(4) driver may find SATA disks which had been
recognized and handled by the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wd.4">wd(4)</a>
(i.e., wd0) to become
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sd.4">sd(4)</a>
(i.e., sd0) devices.
Watch the <tt>dmesg</tt> output at boot.
A drive which turned up earlier as:

<p>
<blockquote><pre>
pciide1 at pci0 dev 31 function 2 "Intel 82801GBM AHCI SATA" rev 0x02: DMA, channel 0 wired to native-PCI, channel 1 wired to native-PCI
pciide1: using apic 2 int 11 (irq 11) for native-PCI interrupt
wd0 at pciide1 channel 0 drive 0: &lt;FUJITSU MHV2080BH&gt;
wd0: 16-sector PIO, LBA48, 76319MB, 156301488 sectors
wd0(pciide1:0:0): using PIO mode 4, Ultra-DMA mode 5
</pre></blockquote>

now instead turns up as:

<p>
<blockquote><pre>
ahci0 at pci0 dev 31 function 2 "Intel 82801GBM AHCI SATA" rev 0x02: AHCI 1.1: apic 2 int 16 (irq 11)
scsibus1 at ahci0: 32 targets
sd0 at scsibus1 targ 0 lun 0: &lt;ATA, FUJITSU MHV2080B, 0084&gt; SCSI2 0/direct fixed
sd0: 76319MB, 76319 cyl, 64 head, 32 sec, 512 bytes/sec, 156301488 sec total
<pre></blockquote>

This will cause problems for people doing remote upgrades of these
machines, as if the fstab file is not "correct", the system will not
complete booting.
Unfortunately, how the driver handles the disk is dependent upon a lot
of things including BIOS configurations, so IF one has an AHCI SATA
interface, one will have to experiment with a similarly configured
local machine to see if the <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> file will need to be
re-worked.

<p>
It is believed very few people will be hit by this now, as ahci(4)
devices are moderately rare on existing hardware, though becoming much
more common now.

<p>
<li id="bgpd"><b>bgpd filter language change:</b><br>
bgpd filters using only <tt>prefixlen</tt> as filter parameter now need to
include an address family identifier like <tt>inet</tt> or
<tt>inet6</tt>:

<p>
<blockquote><pre>
allow from any <b>inet</b> prefixlen 8 - 24
deny from any <b>inet6</b> prefixlen &gt; 64
</pre></blockquote>

<p>As a reminder, bgplg and associated binaries are disabled at
install/upgrade time. If you use them, they must be re-enabled as
described in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgplg.8">bgplg(8)</a>.

<p>
<li id="ssh1"><b>SSH protocol 1 discouraged on new installs:</b><br>
New OpenBSD installs will default to not accepting SSH v1 connections.
This upgrade process will not replace the <tt>/etc/ssh</tt>
configuration files, but you may wish to manually do this to gain the
new behavior.
The following diff shows what has changed on new installs:

<blockquote><pre>
--- ./etc/ssh/sshd_config       Sat Mar 10 20:31:32 2007

+# installations. In future the default will change to require explicit

</pre></blockquote>

Again, this change is NOT part of the standard upgrade process.

<p>
<li id="sudo"><b>Changes in the way sudo(8) passes environment:</b><br>
For security reasons
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sudo.8">sudo(8)</a>
will now reset the environment to a small default set
with only certain variables preserved from the previous environment.

<p>
In order for many things to continue to work as expected, the patch file
<a href="#patchfile">below</a> will add a "<tt>Defaults env_keep</tt>"
line to your <tt>/etc/sudoers</tt> file and otherwise try to make the
file look like the one in <tt>etc42.tgz</tt>, but will possibly fail.
You will want to make sure your <tt>sudoers</tt> file contains
a line that looks something like:
<blockquote><pre>
%wheel       ALL=(ALL) SETENV: ALL
  <i>-- or --</i>
%wheel       ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: SETENV: ALL
</pre></blockquote>

assuming you wish "wheel" group users to have full sudo rights.
It would probably be wise to test sudo(8) for proper operation before
logging out of the system after the patch file is applied.

<p>
<li id="dedc"><b>[alpha Only] Some de(4) NICs will become dc(4):</b><br>
On the <a href="../alpha.html">alpha</a> platform, some NICs which had
been supported by the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/de.4">de(4)</a>
driver will now be supported by
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dc.4">dc(4)</a>.

<p>
IF your NIC is one of these, you will need to alter at least your <tt>/etc/hostname.deX</tt>
(hint: hard link) and your pf.conf files as appropriate.

<p>
Again, this is <i>only</i> on the alpha platform.

<p>
<li id="acpi"><b>[i386 Only] apm(4) takes precedence over acpi(4)</b><br>
The device detection on i386 has been modified to make
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.2/i386/apm.4">
apm(4)</a> take precedence over
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acpi.4">
acpi(4)</a>.
It means that if your hardware has both apm and acpi devices, only apm will
attach.
If for some reason you prefer to use acpi, disable <tt>apm</tt> on your
acpi-enabled kernel using <tt>config(8)</tt> or <tt>boot -c</tt>.

<p>
<li id="rc.conf"><b>rc.conf:</b><br>
Unlike earlier versions of this process, since
<a href="upgrade41.html">4.1</a> it is assumed that
<tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt> is not a user-altered file.
If you have made changes to your <tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt> file, merge those
changes into <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt>.
If you have NO <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt>, simply copy your existing
<tt>/etc/rc.conf</tt> file to <tt>/etc/rc.conf.local</tt> and
<i>delete the last line of the script!</i>
Otherwise, pull your existing <tt>rc.conf</tt> into the top of your
existing <tt>rc.conf.local</tt> file <i>and remove the last line</i>
before doing the rest of this process.

<p>
<li id="kern"><b>Modified kernel:</b><br>
Check whether you have made any modifications to your kernel.
For example, you might have modified your network device to use a
non-default setting using config(8).
Note your changes, so you can repeat them for the new 4.2 kernel.

</ul>

<p>

<h2 id="upgrade">The upgrade process</h2>

<h3>Upgrading by install kernel</h3>
If you have access to the system's console, the easiest and safest way
to upgrade is to boot from install media or
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> and follow the upgrade steps,
which are very similar to the <a href="faq4.html">install process</a>.
Afterwards, complete the upgrade by following the <a href="#final">final
steps</a> as detailed below.

<p>
One easy way to boot from the install kernel is to place the 4.2 version
of <i>bsd.rd</i> in the root of your boot drive, then instruct the boot loader
to boot using this new <i>bsd.rd</i> file.
On amd64 and i386, you do this by entering "<tt>boot bsd.rd</tt>" at the
initial <tt>boot&gt;</tt> prompt.

<h3>Upgrading without install kernel</h3>
<i>This is NOT the recommended process.  Use the install kernel method
if at all possible!</i>

<p>
Sometimes, one needs to do an upgrade of a machine when one can't easily
use the normal upgrade process.
The most common case is when the machine is in a remote location and you
don't have easy access to the system console.
One can usually do this by carefully following this process:

<ul>
<li><b>Place install files in a "good" location</b>.
Make sure you have sufficient space!

<p>
<li><b>Stop any "insecure" applications from starting at boot:</b>
There will be a time when PF will be unlikely to be running during this
upgrade process, but your applications may still start and run properly.
Any application dependent upon PF for security should be disabled
before this happens, and should not be re-enabled until proper PF
operation is verified after upgrade.
There may be other applications which you wish to keep from running
during the upgrade, stop and disable them as well.

<p>
<li><b>Check the kernel:</b>
Although <b>most people can skip this step</b>, if you had a modified kernel
in 4.1, it is likely you will need to modify the stock kernel of 4.2.
Especially when you are performing the upgrade process remotely, now is
the time to make sure the new kernel will work upon rebooting the machine.
If any changes must be made to the kernel, the safest thing to do is to
make those changes on a local 4.2 system.
This can be as simple as modifying a specific device using config(8),
or it can involve a recompilation if the option you need is not included
in the GENERIC kernel.
Please consult <a href="faq5.html">FAQ 5 - Building the system from source</a>
before considering to recompile your kernel.

<p>
<li><b>Install new kernel(s)</b>
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=</b><i>/usr/rel</i>   <i># where you put the files</i>
<b>cd ${RELEASEPATH}</b>
<b>rm /obsd ; ln /bsd /obsd && cp bsd /nbsd && mv /nbsd /bsd</b>
<b>cp bsd.rd bsd.mp /</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Note the extra steps for copying over the primary kernel: those are done
to ensure that there is always a valid copy of the kernel on the disk
that the system can boot from should there be a really badly timed power
outage or system crash.

<p>
<li><b>Install new <tt>/etc/firmware</tt> files:</b>
Due to the fact that some uploaded "firmware" files may have been updated,
you may need to update the files in the <tt>/etc/firmware</tt> directory.
This will impact users of only a few devices, though all users can use
this step without harm.
To extract the firmware files from <tt>base42.tgz</tt>, use the
following as root:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf ${RELEASEPATH}/base42.tgz ./etc/firmware</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<li><b>Reboot on the new kernel:</b>
This might be a tempting step to skip, but it should be done now, as
usually, the new kernel will run old userland apps (such as the soon to
be important <tt>reboot</tt>!), but often a new userland will NOT
work on the old kernel.

<p>
<li><b>Install new userland applications.</b>
<i>Do NOT install <tt>etc42.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc42.tgz</tt> now, because
that will overwrite your current configuration files!</i>

<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=</b><i>/usr/rel</i>
<b>cd ${RELEASEPATH}</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf base42.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf comp42.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf game42.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf man42.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf misc42.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xbase42.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xfont42.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xserv42.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xshare42.tgz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Note: not all file sets will need to be installed for all applications,
however if you installed a file set originally, you should certainly
upgrade it with the new file set now.

<p>
Note: the files in <tt>/etc</tt> are handled separately below, so
<tt>etc42.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc42.tgz</tt> are NOT unpacked here.

<p>
<li><b>Upgrade <tt>/dev</tt>.</b>
The new
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.2/i386/MAKEDEV">MAKEDEV</a>
file will be copied to /dev by the installation of
<tt>base42.tgz</tt>, so you simply need to do the following:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /dev</b>
<b>./MAKEDEV all</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<li><b>Upgrade <tt>/etc</tt> as below</b>.

<p>
<li><b>Reboot</b>
</ul>

During this process,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sendmail.8">sendmail(8)</a>
may produce some error messages like the following:
<pre>
    Nov 1 12:47:05 puffy sm-mta[16733]: filesys_update failed: No such file or directory, fs=., avail=-1, blocksize=380204
</pre>
These messages can be safely ignored for the moment, or you may wish to
halt sendmail(8) during the upgrade process.
Note that sendmail is not working properly at this point, and will need
to be restarted (as part of the reboot) before mail is expected to be
handled properly.

<p>

<hr>
<h2 id="final">Final steps</h2>

Whether you upgrade by using an install kernel and doing a formal
"upgrade" process, or do a "in-place" binary upgrade, there are certain
manual steps that have to be performed.

<h3 id="etcUpgrade">1. Upgrading <tt>/etc</tt></h3>

<p>
You will want to extract the <tt>etc42.tgz</tt> files to a temporary
location:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>tar -C /tmp -xzphf ${RELEASEPATH}/etc42.tgz</b>
</pre></blockquote>


Files that can probably be copied from <tt>etc42.tgz</tt> "as is":

<blockquote><pre>
etc/magic
etc/man.conf
etc/netstart
etc/rc
etc/rc.conf
etc/rpc
etc/services
etc/mail/helpfile
etc/mail/localhost.cf
etc/mail/sendmail.cf
etc/mail/submit.cf
etc/mtree/4.4BSD.dist
etc/mtree/BSD.local.dist
etc/mtree/special
</pre></blockquote>

Note that it IS possible to locally modify these files, if this has been
done, manual merging will be needed.
Pay special attention to <tt>mail/*</tt> if you are using something
other than the default Sendmail(8) configuration.
Here are copy/paste lines for copying these files, assuming you unpacked
<tt>etc42.tgz</tt> in the above recommended place:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /tmp/etc
cp magic man.conf netstart rc rc.conf rpc services /etc
cp mtree/* /etc/mtree/
cp mail/helpfile mail/localhost.cf mail/submit.cf /etc/mail
cp mail/sendmail.cf /etc/mail     </b><i># Careful on this one!!</i>
</pre></blockquote>

<p id="patchfile">
Files that must be manually merged, respecting any local
changes made to them, if they were modified from the default,
otherwise, just copy them over, too:

<blockquote><pre>
etc/ntpd.conf
etc/sensorsd.conf
etc/ssh/ssh_config
etc/ssl/x509v3.cnf
etc/sudoers
etc/sysctl.conf
etc/wsconsctl.conf
var/www/conf/httpd.conf
</pre></blockquote>

The changes to these files are in <a href="upgrade42.patch">this
patch file</a>.
You can attempt to use this by executing the following as root:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /</b>
<b>patch -C -p0 &lt; upgrade42.patch</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This will test the patch to see how well it will apply to YOUR system,
to actually apply it, leave off the "<tt>-C</tt>" option.
Note that it is likely that if you have customized files or not kept
them closely updated, or are upgrading from a snapshot of 3.9, they may
not accept the patch cleanly.
In those cases, you will need to manually apply the changes.
Please test this process before relying on it for a machine you can not
easily get to.

<p>
The following files have had changes which should be looked at, but it
is unlikely they should be directly copied or merged (i.e., if you are
using bgpd.conf, look at the suggested change of strategy, and decide if
it is appropriate for your use).

<blockquote><pre>
etc/bgpd.conf
etc/mail/spamd.conf
etc/ospfd.conf
etc/ssh/sshd_config
</pre></blockquote>

Finally, use
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/newaliases.8">newaliases(8)</a>
to update the aliases database and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mtree.8">mtree(8)</a>
to create any new directories:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>newaliases</b>
<b>mtree -qdef /etc/mtree/4.4BSD.dist -p / -u</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h3 id="Kernchk">2. Checking the kernel</h3>
Note: <b>most people can skip this step!</b>
<p>
If you followed the instructions for the upgrade process without install
kernel, you have already completed this step.
However, if you used the install kernel, and if you had a modified kernel
in 4.1, it is likely you will need to modify the stock kernel of 4.2.
This can be as simple as modifying a specific device using config(8),
or it can involve a recompilation if the option you need is not included
in the GENERIC kernel.
Please consult <a href="faq5.html">FAQ 5 - Building the system from source</a>
before considering to recompile your kernel.

<h3 id="Xup">3. X configuration files</h3>
Due to the significant changes in X for this release, the easiest way to
upgrade your X for 4.2 may be to back up your existing X configuration
files, unpack xetc42.tgz, and manually merge back any changes you had
made.

<p>
The files you are most likely to want to save a copy of are
<tt>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</tt> and <tt>/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc</tt>.
As X now often works with NO xorg.conf file, you may wish to try it
without one before you copy your file back.

<p>
Unpack xetc42.tgz as you would other file sets:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=/usr/rel
cd ${RELEASEPATH}
tar -C / -xzphf xetc42.tgz
</b></pre></blockquote>

<p>

<h3 id="Pkgup">4. Upgrading packages</h3>
If you installed any packages on your system, you should upgrade them
after completing the upgrade of the base system.
Be aware, however, many packages will require further setup before
and/or after upgrading the package.
Check with the application's upgrade guide for details.

<p>
The following package is known to have significant upgrade issues
that will impact a large number of users.
The fact that a package is not on this list doesn't mean it will have a
trivial upgrade.
You must do some homework on the applications YOU use.

<ul>
<li><b>xfce:</b> Configuration base directory and files have completely
changed.  You will probably have to re-create your configuration from
scratch.
</ul>

<p>
Before continuing, there are some major changes in the 4.2 release which
you should know about:

<ul>
<li>The libexpat port has been removed, and packages are now using the
libexpat shipped with X11 instead.
Many packages depend on libexpat through other dependencies.
For instance, all the packages which require gettext also depend on libexpat.
This means that before you can add or upgrade packages, you most likely
need to have <tt>xbase42.tgz</tt> installed, even if the packages you are
installing don't have a graphical operation.
Refer to the
<a href="faq4.html#FilesNeeded">FAQ</a> about adding
<tt>xbase42.tgz</tt> to an installed system.
If you don't do this and try to install a package that requires libexpat,
pkg_add(1) will give an error message.

<li>If you are using pkg_add(1) in combination with sudo(8), you will
need to change your <tt>/etc/sudoers</tt> as the
<a href="#patchfile">patch file</a> attempts to.
See <a href="#sudo">changes in sudo(8)</a> for more info.

</ul>

The package tools support in-place updating using <tt>pkg_add -u</tt>.
For instance, to update all your packages, make sure <tt>PKG_PATH</tt> is
pointing to the 4.2 packages directory on your CD or nearest FTP mirror,
and use something like

<blockquote><pre>
<b># pkg_add -ui -F update -F updatedepends</b>
</pre></blockquote>

where the <tt>-u</tt> indicates update mode, and <tt>-i</tt> specifies
interactive mode, so pkg_add will prompt you for input when it encounters
some ambiguity. Read the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.2/pkg_add">pkg_add(1)</a>
manual page and the <a href="faq15.html">package management</a>
chapter of the FAQ for more information.

<p>
You will very possibly see something like this when running the above
command:
<blockquote><pre>
Looking for updates: complete
Cannot find updates for expat-2.0.0
Proceed? [y/N]
</pre></blockquote>

This is indicating you have run into the libexpat problem and must now
install <tt>xbase42.tgz</tt> as mentioned above.
If you have not installed xbase42.tgz, it is recommended that you stop
the package update, install xbase42.tgz and then re-run the package
upgrade.

<p>
Finally, after upgrading all your packages,
clean up by removing the old expat package from your system:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>pkg_delete expat</b>
