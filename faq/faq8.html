<h2 id="LostPW">I Forgot My Root Password</h2>

The basic process to regain root is to boot into single user mode, mount the
<code>/</code> and <code>/usr</code> partitions and run
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/passwd">passwd(1)</a> to change the root
password:

<ul>
  <li><b>Boot into single user mode.</b>
    This part of the process varies depending on your
    <a href="../plat.html">platform</a>.
    For amd64 and i386, the
    <a href="faq14.html#BootAmd64">second stage boot loader</a>
    pauses for a few seconds to give you a chance to provide parameters
    to the kernel.
    Here you can see we pass the <code>-s</code> flag to
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/i386/boot">boot(8)</a>:

<pre class="cmdbox">
probing: pc0 com0 com1 mem[638K 1918M a20=on]
disk: hd0+ hd1+
>> OpenBSD/amd64 BOOT 3.33
boot> <b>boot -s</b>
</pre>

  <li><b>Mount the partitions.</b>
    Both <code>/</code> and <code>/usr</code> will need to be mounted
    read-write.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>fsck -p / &amp;&amp; mount -uw /</b>
# <b>fsck -p /usr &amp;&amp; mount /usr</b>
</pre>

  <li><b>Run <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/passwd">passwd(1)</a>
    to change the root password.</b>
    From being in single user mode, you already have root privileges, so it
    will not ask you to provide your current password.

  <li><b>Boot into multiuser mode.</b>
    This can be done by either entering "CTRL-D" to resume the normal boot
    process, or by entering the
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/reboot">reboot(8)</a> command.
</ul>

<h2 id="OpenNTPD">Using OpenNTPD</h2>

<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/openntpd">OpenNTPD</a> is a safe and simple
NTP-compatible way to have accurate time on your computer.
The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ntpd">ntpd(8)</a> daemon is enabled by
default at install time, resulting in your computer's clock slowly syncing
with the <a href="http://www.pool.ntp.org">pool.ntp.org</a> time servers.
Once the clock is accurately set,
<code>ntpd</code> will hold it at a high degree of accuracy.
However, if your time is more than a few minutes off, it is recommended to
bring it close to accurate initially with the <code>-s</code> flag.

<p>
To use OpenNTPD as a server, add a <code>listen on *</code> line to your
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ntpd.conf">ntpd.conf(5)</a> file and restart
the daemon.
You can also instruct it to only listen on a specific address or interface.

<p>
When you have <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ntpd">ntpd(8)</a> listening,
other machines may not be able to synchronize their clocks right away.
This is because time information won't be served until the local clock
is synced with a reasonable level of stability.
Once this level is reached, a "clock now synced" message will appear in
<code>/var/log/daemon</code>.

<h2 id="TimeZone">Time Zones</h2>

By default, OpenBSD assumes your hardware clock is set to UTC (Coordinated
Universal Time) rather than local time.
This can cause problems when <a href="faq4.html#Multibooting">multibooting</a>.
Many other operating systems can be configured to do the same, which avoids
this problem altogether.

<p>
If having the hardware clock set to UTC is a problem, you can change the
default behavior of OpenBSD via
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.conf">sysctl.conf(5)</a>.
For example, put the following in <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> to
configure OpenBSD to use a hardware clock set to US Eastern Standard
Time (5 hours behind UTC, so minus 300 minutes):

<pre class="cmdbox">
kern.utc_offset=-300
</pre>

See <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.2">sysctl(2)</a>
and search for "kern.utc_offset" for more information.

<p>
Note that the hardware clock must already be running at the desired
offset before booting OpenBSD with the above configuration or the
system time will be incorrectly adjusted at boot.

<p>
Normally, the time zone is set during install.
If you have need to change the time zone, you can create a new symbolic
link to the appropriate time zone file in <code>/usr/share/zoneinfo</code>.
For example, to set the machine to use EST5EDT as the new local time zone:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>ln -fs /usr/share/zoneinfo/EST5EDT /etc/localtime</b>
</pre>

Also see the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/date">date(1)</a> manual.

<h2 id="locales">Character Sets and Localization</h2>

The OpenBSD base system fully supports the ASCII character set and encoding, and
partially supports the UTF-8 encoding of the Unicode character set.
No other encodings or character sets are supported by the base system, but ports
can be used to handle them.
The level of UTF-8 support and the default encoding configuration vary greatly
with the program or library.

<p>
To use the Unicode character set in UTF-8 encoding wherever supported, set the
<code>LC_CTYPE</code> environment variable to the value
<code>en_US.UTF-8</code>:

<ul>
  <li>
    If logging in via <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/xenodm">xenodm(1)</a>,
    add <code>export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"</code> to your
    <code>~/.xsession</code>
    before starting the window manager.
    See <a href="faq11.html#CustomizingX">customizing X</a> for more details.
  <li>
    If logging in via the text console, add
    <code>export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"</code> to your <code>~/.profile</code>.
    The text console's UTF-8 support is a work in progress, and some non-ASCII
    characters may not display properly.
</ul>

When logging into remote systems with
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>, the <code>LC_CTYPE</code>
environment variable is not propagated, and you have to make sure that the local
terminal is set to the character encoding used by the remote server before
connecting.
If that encoding is unknown or unsupported by OpenBSD, make sure you use the
default <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/xterm">xterm(1)</a> configuration and
set <code>LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8</code> in the remote shell after connecting.

<p>
The OpenBSD base system completely ignores all locale-related environment
variables except <code>LC_CTYPE</code>; even <code>LC_ALL</code> and
<code>LANG</code> only affect the character encoding.
Some ports may respect other <code>LC_*</code> variables,
but using them or setting <code>LC_CTYPE</code> to any value other than
<code>C</code>, <code>POSIX</code> or <code>en_US.UTF-8</code>
is not recommended.

<h2 id="RevDNS">Reverse DNS</h2>

Some new users experience a login delay when using services such as
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>, or when using a proxy or
sending mail.

<p>
This is almost always due to a reverse DNS problem.
DNS is the Domain Name Service, the system the internet uses to convert a name
(such as "www.openbsd.org") into a numeric IP address.
Another task of DNS is the ability to take a numeric address and convert it
back to a name.
This is known as a reverse DNS entry.

<p>
In order to provide better logging, OpenBSD performs a reverse DNS
lookup on any machine that attaches to it in many different ways,
including <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a>,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ftp">ftp(1)</a> and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ftp-proxy">ftp-proxy(8)</a>.
Unfortunately, in some cases, the machine that is making the connection
does not have a proper reverse DNS entry.

<h3>Fix Using the hosts File</h3>

The simplest fix is as follows:
Populate your <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hosts">hosts(5)</a>
file with all the workstations you have in your internal network.
Make sure that your
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/resolv.conf">resolv.conf(5)</a>
file contains the line <code>lookup file bind</code>.
This tells the resolver to start with the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hosts">hosts(5)</a> file,
and, failing that, to use the DNS servers specified by the
<code>nameserver</code>
lines in your <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/resolv.conf">resolv.conf(5)</a>.

<p>
Your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file might look something like this:

<pre class="cmdbox">
::1          localhost.in.example.org localhost
127.0.0.1    localhost.in.example.org localhost
192.168.1.1  gw.in.example.org        gw
192.168.1.20 scrappy.in.example.org   scrappy
192.168.1.35 shadow.in.example.org    shadow
</pre>

Your <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file might look something like this:

<pre class="cmdbox">
search in.example.org
nameserver 24.2.68.33
nameserver 24.2.68.34
lookup file bind
</pre>

If you are using <a href="faq6.html#DHCP">DHCP</a>, you should add
<code>lookup file bind</code> to your <code>/etc/resolv.conf.tail</code> file,
as <code>resolv.conf</code> will be overwritten by
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhclient">dhclient(8)</a>.

<h2 id="GenNotConf">Device "not configured" in dmesg</h2>

In short, it means your device is not supported by the kernel you are using,
so you will not be able to use it.

<p>
PCI and many other types of devices offer identifying information so that
the OS can properly recognize and support devices.
Adding recognition is easy, adding support is often not.
Here are two examples of "not configured" devices:

<pre class="cmdbox">
[...]
vendor "Intel", unknown product 0x5201 (class network subclass ethernet,
rev 0x03) at pci2 dev 9 function 1 not configured
[...]
"Intel EE Pro 100" rev 0x03 at pci2 dev 10 function 0 not configured
[...]
</pre>

Here we have two different network cards, neither of them functional.
The first one had its vendor code identified, and the general type of card
was determined, but not the precise model.
The second one was fully identified, but the <code>not configured</code> line
informs us that no driver was found for it.

<h4>What can I do about a "not configured" device?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>If the device is not one you need, you can safely ignore the
      <code>not configured</code> warnings.
  <li>In some cases, it's just a variation of a supported device.
      This means it may be relatively easy for a developer to add support for
      the new card.
      Otherwise, a new driver would have to be written, which may not even
      be possible if the device is not fully documented.
  <li>If you're running the install kernel, the device may not be supported
      due to space constraints.
      Be sure to try with the standard <code>GENERIC</code> kernel.
  <li>Before reporting a <code>not configured</code> device, make sure you have
      first tested the most recent <a href="faq5.html#Flavors">snapshot</a>,
      as support may already have been added.
      Also check the <a href="../mail.html">mailing list archives</a> to see
      if the issue has been discussed already.
</ul>
