<h2 id="PortsIntro">Introduction</h2>

The ports tree is meant for advanced users.
<b>Everyone is encouraged to use the pre-compiled binary packages.</b>
If you have questions about the ports tree, it is assumed that you have
read the manual pages and this FAQ, and that you are able to work with it.

<p>
The ports tree is a set of Makefiles, one for each third party application,
that controls:

<ul>
  <li>Where and how to fetch the source of the software
  <li>Which other software it depends upon
  <li>How to alter the sources (if necessary)
  <li>How to configure and build it
  <li>How to test it (optional)
  <li>How to install it
</ul>

Apart from the Makefile, each port also contains at least the following:

<ul>
  <li><code>PLIST</code> - instructions for package creation once the
      application has been built
  <li><code>DESCR</code> - description of the application
  <li><code>distinfo</code> - distribution file checksums and size
</ul>

All this information is kept in a directory hierarchy under
<code>/usr/ports</code>.
This hierarchy contains three special subdirectories:

<ul>
  <li><code>distfiles/</code> - where software distribution sets are stored
      after downloading
  <li><code>infrastructure/</code> - all the necessary scripts and makefiles
      for the ports infrastructure
  <li><code>packages/</code> - binary packages built by the ports system
</ul>

The other subdirectories all form different application categories,
which contain the subdirectories of the actual ports.
Complex ports may be organized to an even deeper level, for example if
they have a core part and a set of extensions, or a stable and a snapshot
version of the application.
Every port directory must contain a <code>pkg/</code> subdirectory with
packing list(s) and description file(s).
There may also be <code>patches/</code> and <code>files/</code> subdirectories,
for source patches and additional files, respectively.

<p>
When a user issues <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/make">make(1)</a>
in the subdirectory of a specific port, the system will recursively
walk its dependency tree, check whether the required dependencies are
installed, build and install any missing dependencies, and then
continue the build of the desired port.
All of the building happens inside the <i>working directory</i> that
the port creates.
Normally this is under <code>${WRKOBJDIR}</code>, defaulting to
<code>/usr/ports/pobj</code>, but you may override this (see
<a href="#PortsConfig">configuration of the ports system</a>).

<p>
The ports tree is tied to OpenBSD's <a href="../faq5.html#Flavors">flavors</a>.
Do not check out a -current ports tree and expect it to work on a -release
or -stable system.
<b>If you follow -current, you need both a -current base system and a -current
ports tree</b>.
Because no intrusive changes are made in -stable, it is possible to use
a -stable ports tree on a -release system and vice versa.

<p>
Another common failure is a missing X11 installation.
Even if the port you try to build has no direct dependency on X11, a
subpackage of it or its dependencies may require X11 headers and libraries.
<b>Building ports on systems without X11 is not supported</b>.

<p>
More information about the ports system may be found in these man pages:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ports">ports(7)</a>
  - describes the different stages (make targets) of port installation,
  the use of flavors and subpackages and some other options.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bsd.port.mk">bsd.port.mk(5)</a>
  - in-depth information about all the make targets, variables, the fake
  (installation directory) framework, etc.
</ul>

<h2 id="PortsFetch">Fetching the Ports Tree</h2>

Once you have decided which flavor of the ports tree you want, you can
get it from different sources.
The table below gives an overview of where you can find the different
flavors, and in which form.
An '&#x2713;' marks availability
and '&#x2717;' means it is not available through that specific source.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope=col style="text-align: left">Source
<th scope=col>Form
<th scope=col colspan=4>Flavor
</thead>
<tr>
<td colspan=2>
<th scope=col>-release
<th scope=col>-stable

<th scope=col>-current
<tr>
<th scope=row style="text-align: left"><a href="../../ftp.html">Mirrors</a>

<th scope=row style="text-align: left"><a href="../../anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>
<td>cvs checkout</td>
<td>&#x2713;</td>
<td>&#x2713;</td>
<td>&#x2717;</td>
<td>&#x2713;</td>
</table>

<p>
Look for a file named <code>ports.tar.gz</code> on the mirrors.

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>cd /tmp</b>
$ <b>ftp https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/$(uname -r)/{ports.tar.gz,SHA256.sig}</b>
$ <b>signify -Cp /etc/signify/openbsd-$(uname -r | cut -c 1,3)-base.pub -x SHA256.sig ports.tar.gz</b>
</pre>

You want to untar this file in the <code>/usr</code> directory, which will
create <code>/usr/ports</code> and all the directories under it.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>cd /usr</b>
# <b>tar xzf /tmp/ports.tar.gz</b>
</pre>

The snapshots available on the mirrors are generated daily from the -current
ports tree.
You will find the snapshots in the <code>/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/</code>
directory.
If you are using a snapshot of the ports tree, you should have installed
a matching snapshot of OpenBSD.
Make sure you keep your ports tree and your OpenBSD system in sync!

<p>
For more information about obtaining the ports tree via CVS, read the
<a href="../../anoncvs.html">AnonCVS page</a>, which contains a list of
available servers and a number of examples.

<h2 id="PortsConfig">Configuration of the Ports System</h2>

This section introduces some additional global settings for building ports.
You can skip it, but then you will be required to perform many of the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/make">make(1)</a> statements in later
examples as root.

<p>
Because the OpenBSD project does not have the resources to fully review
the source code of all software in the ports tree, you can configure the
ports system to take a few safety precautions.
The ports infrastructure is able to perform all building as a regular user,
and perform only those steps that require superuser privileges as root
(for example, the <code>install</code> make target).
Details on how to configure privilege separation are in the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bsd.port.mk#PORTS_PRIVSEP">bsd.port.mk(5)</a>
man page.

<p>
It is possible to use a read-only ports tree by separating directories
that are written to during port building:

<ul>
  <li>The working directory of ports.
  This is controlled by the <code>WRKOBJDIR</code> variable, which specifies
  the directory which will contain the working directories.
  <li>The directory containing distribution files.
  This is controlled by the <code>DISTDIR</code> variable.
  <li>The directory containing newly built binary packages.
  This is controlled by the <code>PACKAGE_REPOSITORY</code> variable.
</ul>

For example, you could add the following lines to <code>/etc/mk.conf</code>:

<pre class="cmdbox">
WRKOBJDIR=/usr/obj/ports
DISTDIR=/usr/distfiles
PACKAGE_REPOSITORY=/usr/packages
</pre>

If desired, you can also change the ownership of these directories to your
local username and group, so that the ports system can create the underlying
working directories as a regular user.
Again, ports can be <i>built</i> as a user, but must be <i>installed</i>
by root or with <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/doas">doas(1)</a>.

<h2 id="PortsSearch">Searching the Ports Tree</h2>

Once you have the ports tree and the portslist package in place on your 
system, it becomes very easy to search for software.
Just use <code>make search key="searchkey"</code> as shown in this example:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>cd /usr/ports</b>
$ <b>doas pkg_add portslist</b>
$ <b>make search key=rsnapshot</b>
Port:   rsnapshot-1.4.2
Path:   net/rsnapshot
Info:   remote filesystem snapshot utility
Maint:  Antoine Jacoutot &lt;ajacoutot@openbsd.org&gt;
Index:  net sysutils
L-deps:
B-deps: devel/autoconf/2.69 devel/automake/1.15 devel/metaauto net/rsync
R-deps: devel/p5-Lchown net/rsync
Archs:  any
</pre>

The search result gives a nice overview of each application that is found:
the port name, the path to the port, a one-line description, the port's
maintainer, keywords related to the port, library/build/runtime dependencies,
and architectures on which the port is known to work.

<p>
This mechanism, however, is a very basic one, which just runs awk(1)
on the ports index file.
A port called "sqlports" allows very fine-grained searching using SQL.
It is an SQLite database, but just about any database format can be created
using the ports infrastructure.
The <code>sqlports</code> port
includes the script used to generate the database,
which could be used as a basis to generate databases in different formats.

<p>
Just install the <code>sqlports</code> package to get started.
A sample session could look like this:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>sqlite3 /usr/local/share/sqlports</b>
sqlite> SELECT FULLPKGNAME,COMMENT FROM Ports WHERE COMMENT LIKE '%statistics%';
pg_statsinfo-3.3.0p0|monitor PostgreSQL activity & statistics
kactivities-stats-5.51.0|statistics for the KDE Activity concept
p5-Devel-Cover-Report-Clover-0.35|backend for Clover reporting of coverage statistics

kdf-4.14.3p4|KDE storage device statistics
libsysstat-0.4.1|library used to query system info and statistics
qdirstat-1.4p1|Qt-based directory statistics
sqlite>
</pre>

The above is still a very basic search.
With SQL, just about anything can be searched for, including dependencies,
configure flags, shared libraries, etc.

<h2 id="PortsInstall">Straightforward Installation: A Simple Example</h2>

For clarity's sake, let's consider a simple example: rsnapshot.
This application has several build dependencies: devel/autoconf/2.69
devel/automake/1.15 devel/metaauto net/rsync
The following commands assume you've configured PORTS_PRIVSEP as detailed in
the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bsd.port.mk#PORTS_PRIVSEP">bsd.port.mk</a>
manual.

</pre>

<p>
As you can see, the ports system is doing many things automatically.
It will fetch, extract, and patch the source code, configure and build
(compile) the source, install the files into a fake directory, create
a package (corresponding to the packing list) and install this package
onto your system (usually under <code>/usr/local/</code>).
And it does this recursively <b>for all dependencies</b> of the port.
Notice the
"<code>===&gt; Verifying install for ...</code>" and
"<code>===&gt; Returning to build of ...</code>" lines in the above output,
indicating the walk through the dependency tree.

<p>
If a previous version of the application you want to install was already
installed on your system, you can use <code>make update</code> instead of
<code>make install</code>.
This will call <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add">pkg_add(1)</a>
with the <code>-r</code> flag.

<p>
Large applications will require a lot of system resources to build.
If you get "out of memory" type of errors when building such a port,
this usually has one of two causes:

<ul>
  <li>Your resource limits are too restrictive.
      Adjust them with ksh's <code>ulimit</code>
      or csh's <code>limit</code> command.
  <li>You simply don't have enough RAM.
</ul>

<h2 id="PortsClean">Cleaning Up After a Build</h2>

You probably want to clean the port's default working directory after
you have built the package and installed it.

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>make clean</b>
===&gt;  Cleaning for rsnapshot-1.4.2
</pre>

By default, workdir dependencies are automatically cleaned.
You can remove installed packages that were only needed for building with

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>pkg_delete -a</b>
p5-Module-Build-0.4224: ok
autoconf-2.69p2:automake-1.15.1: ok
autoconf-2.69p2: ok
metaauto-1.0p1: ok
Read shared items: ok
</pre>

If you wish to remove the source distribution set(s) of the port, you
would use:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>make clean=dist</b>
===&gt;  Cleaning for rsnapshot-1.4.2
===&gt;  Dist cleaning for rsnapshot-1.4.2
</pre>

In case you have been compiling multiple flavors of the same port,
you can clear the working directories of all these flavors at once using:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>make clean=flavors</b>
</pre>

You can also clean everything up after each build by changing <code>BULK</code>
from <code>auto</code> to <code>Yes</code>.

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>make package BULK=Yes</b>
</pre>

<h2 id="PortsDelete">Uninstalling a Port's Package</h2>

It is very easy to uninstall a port:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>make uninstall</b>
===&gt; Deinstalling for rsnapshot-1.4.2
rsnapshot-1.4.2: ok
Read shared items: ok
</pre>

This will call <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_delete">pkg_delete(1)</a>
to have the corresponding package removed from your system.

If you would like to get rid of the packages you just built, you can do so
as follows:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>make clean=packages</b>
===&gt;  Cleaning for rsnapshot-1.4.2
rm -f /usr/ports/packages/amd64/all/rsnapshot-1.4.2.tgz
</pre>

<h2 id="PortsFlavors">Using Flavors and Subpackages</h2>

Please read the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ports">ports(7)</a>
man page, which gives a good overview of this topic.
There are two mechanisms to control the packaging of software according
to different needs.

<p>
The first mechanism is called <b>flavors</b>.
A flavor usually indicates a certain set of compilation options.
For instance, some applications have a "no_x11" flavor which can be used on
systems without X.
Some shells have a "static" flavor that will build a statically linked
version.
There are ports which have different flavors for building them with
different graphical toolkits.
Other examples include support for different database formats,
different networking options (SSL, IPv6, ...), different paper sizes, etc.

<p>
<b>Summary:</b>
You will most likely use flavors when a package has not been made available
for the flavor you are looking for.
In this case, you can specify the desired flavor and build the port yourself.

<p>
Most port flavors have their own working directory during compilation,
and every flavor will be packaged into a correspondingly-named package to
avoid any confusion.
To see the different flavors of a certain port, you would change to its
subdirectory and issue:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>make show=FLAVORS</b>
</pre>

You can also look at the port's <code>DESCR</code> files, which explain the
available flavors in more detail.

<p>
The second mechanism is called <b>subpackages</b>.
A porter may decide to create subpackages for different pieces of the
same application if they can be logically separated.
You will often see subpackages for the client part and the server part
of a program.
Sometimes extensive documentation is bundled in a separate subpackage
because it takes up a lot of disk space.
Extra functionality that pulls in heavy dependencies will often be
packaged separately.
The porter will also decide which subpackage is the main subpackage,
to be installed as a default.
Other examples are extensive test suites which come with the software,
separate modules with support for different things, etc.

<p>
<b>Summary:</b>
Some ports are split into several packages. <code>make install</code> will only
install the main subpackage.

<p>
To list the different packages built by a port, use:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>make show=PKGNAMES</b>
</pre>

<code>make install</code> will only install the main subpackage.
To install them all, use:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>make install-all</b>
</pre>

To list the different subpackages available for a port, use:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>make show=MULTI_PACKAGES</b>
</pre>

It is possible to select which subpackage(s) to install from within the
ports tree.
After some tests, this procedure will just call
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add">pkg_add(1)</a>
to install the desired subpackage(s).

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>env SUBPACKAGE="-server" make install</b>
</pre>

The subpackages mechanism only handles packages.
It does not modify any configuration options before building the port.
You must use flavors for that purpose.

<h2 id="dpb">Using dpb to Build Multiple Ports</h2>

When you need to build more than one or two ports at a time, you can
use the <code>/usr/ports/infrastructure/bin/dpb</code> tool.

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dpb">dpb(1)</a> takes a list of ports to build
and automatically builds them all in an optimal order, making use of as much
parallelism as possible.
It can also use multiple machines to perform the building, and produces
detailed logs of the build process for troubleshooting, placed in
<code>/usr/ports/logs</code> by default.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>/usr/ports/infrastructure/bin/dpb -P ~/localports</b>
</pre>

This command will read the list of
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkgpath">pkgpaths</a>
in <code>~/localports</code> and build all the packages.
It can also install the packages after they have been built.
The <code>~/localports</code> file might look something like this:

<pre class="cmdbox">
net/rsync
www/mozilla-firefox
editors/vim
</pre>

If you do not provide a list of ports to build on the command line or via
<code>-P</code> or <code>-I</code>,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dpb">dpb(1)</a>
will build all the ports in the ports tree.
If run as root, dpb will automatically drop privileges to dedicated users
for fetching distfiles and building ports.
This is the recommended way to use it, but it can also run as a regular user.
Additionally, the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/proot">proot(1)</a> utility
can be used to further isolate building operations.

<h2 id="PortsSecurity">Security Updates (-stable)</h2>

When serious bugs or security flaws are discovered in third party software,
they are fixed in the -stable branch of the ports tree.
In contrast to the base system, the -stable ports tree only gets security
backports for the latest release.

<p>
This means that all you need to do is make sure you check out the correct
branch of the ports tree, and build the desired software from it.
You can keep your tree up to date with <a href="../../anoncvs.html">CVS</a>
and subscribe to the ports-changes <a href="../../mail.html">mailing list</a>
to receive security announcements related to software in the ports tree.

<h2 id="PkgSig">Package Signatures</h2>

Signatures are a good way to make sure packages are legitimate and not
corrupted.
OpenBSD offers official signed packages using
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/signify">signify(1)</a>.
No extra effort is needed on the user's part to ensure packages haven't
been tampered with.

<p>
If you want to build <i>your own</i> signed packages, you'll first need
to create keys for signing.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>signify -Gns /etc/signify/my-pkg.sec -p /etc/signify/my-pkg.pub</b>
</pre>

Note the names: keys for signing packages should end in <code>pkg</code>.

<p>
Existing packages may be signed with
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_sign">pkg_sign(1)</a> after being built.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>cd /usr/ports/packages/$(uname -p)</b>
# <b>pkg_sign -s signify2 -s /etc/signify/my-pkg.sec -o signed -S all</b>
</pre>

In order to install the package on another machine,
the public key <code>my-pkg.pub</code> should be put into
the <code>/etc/signify</code> directory on that machine.

<h2 id="Problems">Reporting Problems</h2>

If you have trouble with an existing port, please send an email to the
port maintainer.
To see the maintainer of the port, type, for example:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>cd /usr/ports/archivers/unzip</b>
$ <b>make show=MAINTAINER</b>
</pre>

Alternatively, if there is no maintainer, or you can't reach them, send an
email to the <a href="mailto:ports@openbsd.org">ports@openbsd.org</a>
mailing list.

<p>
In any case, please provide:

<ul>
  <li>Your OpenBSD version, including any patches you may have applied.
  The kernel version is given by: <code>sysctl -n kern.version</code>
  <li>The version of your ports tree:
  if the file <code>/usr/ports/CVS/Tag</code>
  exists, provide its contents.
  If this file is absent, you are using the -current ports tree.
  <li>A complete description of the problem.
  Don't be afraid to provide details.
  Mention all the steps you followed before the problem occurred.
  Is the problem reproducible?
  The more information you provide, the more likely you will get help.
</ul>

For ports which do not build correctly, a complete build transcript is
almost always required.
You can use the <code>portslogger</code> script, found in
<code>/usr/ports/infrastructure/bin</code>, for this.
A sample run might look like this:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>mkdir ~/portlog</b>
$ <b>cd /usr/ports/archivers/unzip</b>
$ <b>make 2&gt;&amp;1 | /usr/ports/infrastructure/bin/portslogger ~/portlog</b>
</pre>

After this,
you should have a logfile of the build in your <code>~/portlog</code>
directory that you can send to the port maintainer.
Also, make sure you are not using any special options in your build,
for example in <code>/etc/mk.conf</code>.

<p>
Alternatively, you can:

<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/script">script(1)</a> to create
      a complete build transcript.
  <li>Attach the output of
  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_info">pkg_info(1)</a>
  if it seems even remotely relevant.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/gcc">gcc(1)</a>
  internal compiler errors ask you to report the bug to the gcc
  mailing list.
  It does save time if you follow their direction, and provide at least
  the various files produced by <code>gcc -save-temps</code>.
</ul>

<h2 id="Helping">Helping Us</h2>

There are many ways you can help.
They are listed below, by increasing order of difficulty.

<ul>
  <li><a href="#Problems">Report problems</a> as you experience them.
  <li>You can systematically test ports and report breakages, or suggest
  improvements.
  Just have a look at the <a href="testing.html">Port Testing Guide</a>.
  You <b>must run a -current system</b> for creating and testing ports.
  <li>Test the updates to ports which are posted to the ports mailing list.
  <li>Send updates or patches to a port's maintainer, or to the ports
  mailing list if the port has no maintainer.
  Generally this is highly appreciated, unless your patches will cause
  developers to waste time rather than save time.
  <li><a href="guide.html">Create new ports</a>.

<a href="../../want.html">Hardware</a> donations can assist
testing ports on the various <a href="../../plat.html">platforms</a>
OpenBSD runs on.
