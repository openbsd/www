<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

The <a href="ports.html">ports tree</a> is a huge piece of work
that permits OpenBSD users to use third party programs without wasting time
patching, configuring and installing each one individually.
This work is done by a group of volunteers who spend their time porting and
testing applications across the range of OpenBSD platforms.

<p>
Many people think that they cannot help this process because they do not have
enough knowledge, but this is wrong because they can help porters work better
and faster.
Test submitted updates or new ports which are posted on the
<a href="../../mail.html">ports mailing list</a>.
By doing this, you reduce the latency of commits and also increase the number
of ports to be committed.
Many ports are not committed because of lack of testing.

<p>
The ports tree is developed against <a href="../faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a>;
there is no guarantee that new ports or updates will work correctly on the
other branches.
This means you should upgrade your system and ports tree to -current.
Instructions on how to do this can be found at the
<a href="../current.html">following current</a> page.
It is also recommended that you subscribe to the ports and ports-changes
mailing lists.
This way, you will be notified about new or updated ports and about changes
in the ports tree.

<h2 id="Testing">Testing</h2>

There are two types of submissions on the mailing lists: new ports and updates.
New ports are generally posted as tarball attachments or URLs.
A good idea is to extract them into the <code>/usr/ports/mystuff/</code>
directory and test from there.
Updates are generally a diff against the -current ports tree, so it is best
to copy the port to <code>mystuff/</code> and apply the diff to prevent tree
breakage.
If the previous version of the port is installed, it is a good idea to remove
it before building the newer version to avoid side effects, like symbols
missing from the older version of a library.

<p>
Step-by-step building is needed to verify that every target, see
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ports">ports(7)</a>, is achieved correctly:

<ul><li>
<i>fetch</i>
<ul><li>
Needed to verify that distfile(s) are correctly downloaded.
Try to test all of the <code>MASTER_SITES</code> specified to make sure they
are all valid sources.
</ul>

<li>
<i>checksum</i>
<ul><li>
Verify that downloaded distfiles match the checksums recorded in the
<code>distinfo</code> file.
To download the distfiles from all defined sources and to check their
checksum you can run this command line from within the directory of
the port:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>for ms in $(make show=MASTER_SITES); do make clean=dist; make fetch checksum MASTER_SITES=$ms; done</b>
</pre>
</ul>

<li>
<i>extract</i>
<ul><li>
The <code>prepare</code> target is automatically invoked
before <code>extract</code>
and should install all <code>{BUILD,LIB}_DEPENDS</code> for this port (such as
bzip2).
</ul>

<li>
<i>patch</i>
<ul><li>
Patches should apply cleanly without any warnings.

<li>
There shouldn't be any ".orig" files left behind in the <code>patches/</code>
directory.

<li>
Another common mistake is to include RCS tags in a patch; this will break when
the port is checked into the repository and the RCS tag expanded.
</ul>

<li>
<i>configure</i>
<ul><li>
Check that configure scripts correctly detect features on your platform.

<li>
The configure script should not detect stray applications already installed
on your system without explicit dependencies being set in the port.

<li>
If the port does not build with the libtool from base, you can try setting
<code>USE_LIBTOOL=gnu</code> which uses a patched version from ports.
GNU libtool is notorious for undesired 'features' on OpenBSD, so
if the port does not build with the libtool from base, that should
be fixed and there should be a XXX comment about why in the ports
<code>Makefile</code>.

<li>
If the port uses CMake and you see undesired results of configure stage,
make sure to check or send the following files additionally:

<ul>
<li>
<code>${WRKBUILD}/CMakeCache.txt</code>
<li>
<code>${WRKBUILD}/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log</code>
<li>
<code>${WRKBUILD}/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log</code>
</ul>

</ul>

<li>
<i>build</i>
<ul><li>
Check for build errors and suspicious warnings.

<li>
Warnings about <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmpnam">tmpnam(3)</a> issues
should be resolved by using
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mkstemp">mkstemp(3)</a>.

<li>
Try to set the <code>SEPARATE_BUILD</code> variable to 'Yes'
and test if the build still works.

<li>
Make sure dependencies on GNU make are really necessary.
</ul>

<li>
<i>test</i>
<ul><li>
Check for errors (empty tests means okay).
 
<li>
If the tests have dependencies other than specified in
<code>{BUILD,RUN}_DEPENDS</code>, check that <code>TEST_DEPENDS</code> is
defined correctly.
</ul>


<li>
<i>fake</i>
<ul><li>
This target installs the application into a fake working directory, to ensure
that all files can be easily packaged up without affecting the base system.

<li>
The port should <b>never</b> install files outside of the fake directory 
such as into <code>/usr/local</code>.

<li>
GNU libtool occasionally has trouble relinking libraries during the fake
process on some architectures.

<li>Check whether all files get installed with correct ownerships and
permissions.
</ul>

<li>
<i>port-lib-depends-check</i>
<ul><li>
This will check whether all libraries on which the port depends can be reached
through either <code>LIB_DEPENDS</code> or <code>WANTLIB</code>.
The result should be empty.
The above variables should be inspected when you see lines starting "Extra"
or "Missing."
</ul>

<li>
<i>package</i>
<ul><li>
Package creation can break if <code>pkg/PLIST*</code> and/or
<code>pkg/PFRAG*</code>
are wrong.
</ul>

<li>
<i>install</i>
<ul><li>
Packages should install all of the files from their packaging lists
successfully and with the correct permissions.
Be especially careful of files with the setuid bits set.

<li>
Make sure that the package <code>INSTALL</code> script works correctly, and does
not overwrite any files in <code>/etc</code>.
</ul>

<li>
<i>deinstall</i>
<ul><li>
This should remove all files installed by the package, except those in
<code>/etc</code>.

<li>
System files created by the package at runtime should be marked with
<code>@extra</code> and/or
<code>@extraunexec</code> annotations in <code>pkg/PLIST*</code>.
</ul>

</ul>

<p>
Remaining <code>pkg/</code> files like <code>DESCR</code> and
<code>MESSAGE</code> should be checked for grammar and typos.
Paragraphs should be formatted using
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fmt">fmt(1)</a> and wrapped at 80 characters.

<h2 id="Commenting">Commenting</h2>

At the end of the test comes the really important thing: comments.
Even if the port is working fine comments must be done.
If we have ten posts where people say that the port runs fine under different
architectures then the commit is done faster.
If it does not work, then some information must be given.
There are tools that can help in this task, like
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/portslogger">portslogger(1)</a> which is
like an "intelligent tee" that redirects output into a log file.

<p>
Example:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>make install 2&gt;&amp;1 | /usr/ports/infrastructure/bin/portslogger .</b>
</pre>

This will redirect the output into a log file located in the current directory.

<p>
Finally, once the port is found to be okay, other ports depending on it should
also be tested, to check whether they are still working correctly.
The <code>show-required-by</code> make target will help to find other ports
which depend on the current one.

<h2 id="More">More Testing</h2>

Check the port's <code>Makefile</code> for correct dependencies, typos,
incorrect links, useless or missing variables, correct licensing and categories.
Those who are more skilled can help by examining patches, as well as
providing diffs to correct bugs, add flavors, or other enhancements.

<p>
These diffs should be done with the <code>-uNprx CVS</code> options.
<code>cvs diff -uNp</code> can also be used to generate patches against the CVS
repository.
