<h1><font color="#e00000">Upgrade Guide: 3.6 to 3.7</font></h1>
<hr>

<i>Note: Upgrades are only supported from one release to the release
immediately following it.
Do not skip releases.</i>

<p>
Upgrading is a convenient way to bring your OpenBSD system up to the most
recent version.
However, the results are not intended to precisely match the results of
a wipe-and-reload installation.
Old library files in particular are not removed in the upgrade process,
as they may be required by older applications that may or may not be
upgraded at this time.
If you REALLY wish to get rid of all these old files, you would probably
be better off reinstalling from scratch.

<h2>Before upgrading...</h2>
Before upgrading, some users choose to remove all
<a href="faq8.html#Packages">packages</a>, and installing new versions
after upgrade.
<b>If your platform is one of those that switched to gcc3 (macppc,
i386), you MUST do this.</b>


<p>
To quickly remove all packages from your system:
<blockquote><pre>
pkg_delete -q /var/db/pkg/*
</pre></blockquote>
After the upgrade, install the new versions of these applications.

<p>
<b>i386, macppc users:</b>
Due to the switch to gcc3, you must remove the <tt>/usr/include/g++</tt>
directory before upgrade, either with or without install media.

<blockquote><pre>
rm -rf /usr/include/g++
</pre></blockquote>

<h2>Upgrading by install media</h2>
The easiest and safest way to upgrade from binary files is to boot from
install media and follow the upgrade steps, which are very similar to
the <a href="faq4.html">install process</a>.
Afterwards, do the <a href="#etcUpdates"><tt>/etc</tt> updates</a> below.

<p>
<h2>Upgrading without install media</h2>
<i>This is not the recommended process.  Use the install media method
if at all possible!</i>

<p>
Sometimes, one needs to do an upgrade of a machine when one can't easily
use the normal upgrade process.
One can usually do this by carefully following a process similar to a 
source-based upgrade:

<ul>
<li><b>Place install files in a "good" location</b>.
Make sure you have sufficient room!

<li><b>Install new kernel(s)</b>
<blockquote><pre>
cd /<i>path</i>
rm /obsd ; ln /bsd /obsd && cp bsd /nbsd && mv /nbsd /bsd
cp bsd.rd bsd.mp /
</pre></blockquote>

Note the extra steps for copying over the primary kernel: those are done
to ensure that there is always a valid copy of the kernel on the disk
that the system can boot from should there be a really badly timed power
outage or system crash.

<li><b>Install new <tt>/etc/firmware</tt> files:</b>
Due to the fact that some uploaded "firmware" blobs were relocated from
the kernel to a file in the <tt>/etc/firmware</tt> directory, there are
a few drivers which will break if there is no uploadable firmware file
available when the new kernel boots.
This will impact users of only a few devices, though all
users can use this step without harm.
To extract the firmware files from <tt>base37.tgz</tt>, use the
following as root:

<blockquote><pre>
cd /
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/base37.tgz "*etc/firmware/*"
</pre></blockquote>

before the next step.
</blockquote>

<li><b>Reboot on the new kernel:</b>
This might be a tempting step to skip, but it should be done now, as
usually, the new kernel will run old userland apps (such as the soon to
be important <tt>reboot</tt>!), but often a new userland will NOT
work on the old kernel.

<li><b>Stop any applications which might cause problems in the following
steps.</b>

<li><b>Install new userland applications</b>
<blockquote><pre>
cd /
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/base37.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/comp37.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/game37.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/man37.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/misc37.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/xbase37.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/xfont37.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/xserv37.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/xshare37.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/xetc37.tgz           <i>(see note below)</i>
</pre></blockquote>
Note: not all file sets will need to be installed for all applications,
however, if you installed a file set originally, you should certainly
upgrade it with the new file set now.
Also note that <tt>etc37.tgz</tt> is NOT unpacked here, as it is handled
separately.

<p>
<b>Note about <tt>xetc37.tgz</tt>:</b>
This file contains a lot of configuration options for X applications.
If you have made important manual changes to these files for any reason,
you should NOT unpack the <tt>xetc37.tgz</tt> file as above, but rather
manually merge your changes into the new files.
Many users can simply unpack <tt>xetc37.tgz</tt> without concern,
however.

<li><b>Update <tt>/dev</tt>.</b>
The new 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=MAKEDEV&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">MAKEDEV</a>
file will be copied to /dev by the installation of
<tt>base37.tgz</tt>, so you simply need to do the following:
<blockquote><pre>
cd /dev
./MAKEDEV all
</pre></blockquote>

<li><b>Upgrade <tt>/etc</tt> as below</b>.

<li><b>Reboot</b>
</ul>

During this process,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sendmail&amp;sektion=8">sendmail(8)</a>
may produce some error messages like the following:
<pre>
    Nov 1 12:47:05 puffy sm-mta[16733]: filesys_update failed: No such file or dire
    ctory, fs=., avail=-1, blocksize=380204
</pre>
These messages can be safely ignored, or you may wish to halt
sendmail(8) during the upgrade process.

<hr>
<p>
<a name="etcUpdates"></a>
<h2>Updates to <tt>/etc</tt></h2>

Whether you upgrade by using an install media and doing a formal
"upgrade" process, or do a "in-place" binary upgrade, there are certain
manual steps that have to be performed.

<a name="users"></a>
<h4>New users and groups</h4>
The FTP daemon has been reworked to drop privileges, and an OSPF daemon
has been added, so new users and groups are required.

As <i>root</i>, add the following users and groups, using 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=useradd&amp;sektion=8">useradd(8)</a>:

<blockquote><pre>
useradd -u84 -g=uid -c"FTP Daemon" -d/var/empty -s/sbin/nologin _ftp
useradd -u85 -g=uid -c"OSPF Daemon" -d/var/empty -s/sbin/nologin _ospfd
</pre></blockquote>

These steps will add both the new users and their corresponding groups.
Your environment may allow you to cut/paste those commands.


<a name="apps"></a>
<h4>Userland Applications</h4>

<p>
<b>X.org replaces XFree86:</b>
Due the XFree86 project's change of license, OpenBSD has switched to the 
<a href="http://www.x.org">X.org project's</a> X Window System.
If you have an <tt>/etc/X11/XF86Config</tt> file that works on OpenBSD
3.6, renaming it to <tt>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</tt> will probably give you a
fully functioning X Window system on OpenBSD 3.7.

<p>
<b>bgpd(8) behavior change:</b>
The new <i>rde route-age [evaluate|ignore]</i> changed behavior of bgpd.
Until now <i>evaluate</i> was the implicit default but now the default
is <i>ignore</i>.
Route age evaluation is not specified in RFC 1771 and results in non
deterministic decisions in preference for more stable links.

<p>
<b>pfsync takes syncdev instead of syncif:</b>
When configuring the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pfsync&amp;sektion=4">pfsync</a>
device, use 'syncdev' instead of the deprecated keyword 'syncif'.

<p>
<b>OpenNTPD now does a "-s" by default:</b>
Many 3.6 users manually added the "-s" option to their rc.conf file to
cause OpenNTPD to immediately synchronize the clock on boot.
This is now the default behavior of OpenNTPD, so this is no longer
needed.

<a name="etcfiles"></a>
<h4><tt>/etc</tt> file changes</h4>
You will want to extract the <tt>etc37.tgz</tt> files to a temporary
location:
<blockquote><pre>
cd /tmp
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/etc37.tgz
</pre></blockquote>


Files that can probably be copied from <tt>etc37.tgz</tt> "as is":

<blockquote><pre>
changelist
daily
fbtab
moduli
netstart
ospfd.conf
rc
security
services
mtree/*
</pre></blockquote>

Note that it IS possible to locally modify these files, if this has been
done, manual merging will be needed.
Here are copy/paste lines for copying these files, assuming you unpacked 
<tt>etc37.tgz</tt> in the above recommended place:

<blockquote><pre>
cd /tmp/etc
cp changelist daily fbtab moduli netstart ospfd.conf rc security services /etc
cp mtree/* /etc/mtree/
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Files that must be manually merged, respecting any local 
changes made to them, if they were modified from the default, 
otherwise, just copy them over, too:

<blockquote><pre>
ftpusers
rc.conf
spamd.conf
sysctl.conf
mail/aliases
skel/dot.cshrc
skel/dot.profile
</pre></blockquote>

Finally, use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mtree&amp;sektion=8">mtree(8)</a>
to create any new directories:
<blockquote><pre>
mtree -qdef /etc/mtree/4.4BSD.dist -p / -u
</pre></blockquote>
