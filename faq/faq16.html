<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

OpenBSD comes with the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm">vmm(4)</a>
hypervisor and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd">vmd(8)</a> daemon.
Virtual machines can be orchestrated with the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmctl">vmctl(8)</a> control utility,
using configuration settings stored in the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vm.conf">vm.conf(5)</a> file.

<p>
The following features are available:

<ul>
  <li>serial console access to the virtual machines
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tap">tap(4)</a> interfaces
  <li>per-VM user/group ownership
  <li>privilege separation
  <li>raw, qcow2 and qcow2-derived images
  <li>dumping and restoring of guest system memory
  <li>virtual switch management
  <li>pausing and unpausing VMs
</ul>

The following features are not available at this time:

<ul>
  <li>graphics
  <li>snapshots
  <li>guest SMP support
  <li>hardware passthrough
  <li>live migration across hosts
  <li>live hardware change
</ul>

<!-- XXXrelease - update when vmm supports vga or more oses -->
Supported guest operating systems are currently limited to OpenBSD and Linux.
As there is no VGA support yet, the guest OS must support serial console.

<h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

A CPU with nested paging support is required to use
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm">vmm(4)</a>.
Support can be checked by looking at the processor feature flags: SLAT for
AMD or EPT for Intel.
In some cases, virtualization capabilities must be manually enabled in the
system's BIOS.
Be sure to run the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fw_update">fw_update(8)</a>
command after doing so to get the required <code>vmm-firmware</code> package.

<p>
Processor compatibility can be checked with the following command:

<pre class="cmdbox">
$ <b>dmesg | egrep '(VMX/EPT|SVM/RVI)'</b>
</pre>

Before going further, enable and start the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd">vmd(8)</a> service.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>rcctl enable vmd</b>
# <b>rcctl start vmd</b>
</pre>

<h2 id="StartVm">Starting a VM</h2>

In the following example, a VM will be created with 50GB of disk space and 1GB
of RAM.
It will boot from the <code>install78.iso</code> image file.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>vmctl create -s 50G disk.qcow2</b>
vmctl: qcow2 imagefile created
# <b>vmctl start -m 1G -L -i 1 -r install78.iso -d disk.qcow2 example</b>
vmctl: started vm 1 successfully, tty /dev/ttyp8
# <b>vmctl show</b>
   ID   PID VCPUS  MAXMEM  CURMEM     TTY        OWNER NAME
    1 72118     1    1.0G   88.1M   ttyp8         root example
</pre>

To view the console of the newly created VM, attach to its serial console:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>vmctl console example</b>
Connected to /dev/ttyp8 (speed 115200)
</pre>

The escape sequence <code>~.</code> is needed to leave the serial console.
See the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cu">cu(1)</a> man page for more info.
When using a <code>vmctl</code> serial console over SSH, the ~ (tilde)
character must be escaped to prevent
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">ssh(1)</a> from dropping the connection.
To exit a serial console over SSH, use <code>~~.</code> instead.

<p>
The VM can be stopped using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmctl">vmctl(8)</a>.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>vmctl stop example</b>
stopping vm: requested to shutdown vm 1
</pre>

Virtual machines can be started with or without a
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vm.conf">vm.conf(5)</a> file in place.
The following <code>/etc/vm.conf</code> example would replicate the above
configuration:

<pre class="cmdbox">
vm "example" {
    memory 1G
    enable
    disk /home/user/disk.qcow2
    local interface
}
</pre>

Some configuration properties in
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vm.conf">vm.conf(5)</a>
can be reloaded by <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd">vmd(8)</a> on the fly.
<!-- XXX specify which ones -->
Other changes, like adjusting the amount of RAM or disk space, require the VM
to be restarted.

<h2 id="VMMnet">Networking</h2>

Network access to <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm">vmm(4)</a> guests
can be configured a number of different ways, four of which are detailed
in this section.

<p>
In the examples below, various IPv4 address ranges will be mentioned for
different use cases:

<ul>
  <li><b>Private Addresses</b>
      (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">RFC1918</a>) are those
      reserved for private networks such as <code>10.0.0.0/8</code>,
      <code>172.16.0.0/12</code>, and <code>192.168.0.0/16</code> are not
      globally routable.
  <li><b>Shared Addresses</b>
      (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598">RFC6598</a>) are similar
      to private addresses in that they are not globally routable, but are
      intended to be used on equipment that can perform address translation.
      The address space is <code>100.64.0.0/10</code>.
</ul>

<h3>Option 1 - VMs only need to talk to the host and each other</h3>

For this setup, vmm uses <i>local interfaces</i>: interfaces that use
the shared address space defined above.

<p>
Using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmctl">vmctl(8)</a>'s <code>-L</code>
flag creates a local interface in the guest which will receive an address
from vmd via DHCP.
This essentially creates two interfaces: one for the host and the other
for the VM.

<h3>Option 2 - NAT for the VMs</h3>

This setup builds upon the previous and allows VMs to connect outside
the host.
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.2#ip.forwarding">IP forwarding</a>
is required for it to work.

<p>
The following line in <code>/etc/pf.conf</code> will enable
<a href="pf/nat.html">Network Address Translation</a> and redirect DNS requests
to the specified server:

<pre class="cmdbox">
match out on egress from 100.64.0.0/10 to any nat-to (egress)
pass in proto { udp tcp } from 100.64.0.0/10 to any port domain \
	rdr-to $dns_server port domain
</pre>

Reload the pf ruleset and the VM(s) can now connect to the internet.

<h3>Option 3 - Additional control over the VM network configuration</h3>

Sometimes you may want additional control over the virtual network for your
VMs, such as being able to put certain ones on their own virtual switch.
This can be done using a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/veb">veb(4)</a>
and a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vport">vport(4)</a> interface.

<p>
Create a <code>vport0</code> interface that will have a private IPv4 address
as defined above.
In this example, we'll use the <code>10.0.0.0/8</code> subnet.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>cat &lt;&lt;END > /etc/hostname.vport0
inet 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
up
END</b>
# <b>sh /etc/netstart vport0</b>
</pre>

Create the <code>veb0</code> interface with the <code>vport0</code>
interface as a child interface:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>cat &lt;&lt;END > /etc/hostname.veb0
add vport0
up
END</b>
# <b>sh /etc/netstart veb0</b>
</pre>

Ensure that NAT is set up properly if the guests on the virtual network
need access beyond the physical machine.
An adjusted NAT line in <code>/etc/pf.conf</code> might look like this:

<pre class="cmdbox">
match out on egress from vport0:network to any nat-to (egress)
</pre>

The following lines in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vm.conf">vm.conf(5)</a>
can be used to ensure that a virtual switch is defined:

<pre class="cmdbox">
switch "my_switch" {
    interface veb0
}

vm "my_vm" {
    ...
    interface { switch "my_switch" }
}
</pre>

Inside the <code>my_vm</code> guest, it's now possible to assign
<code>vio0</code>
an address on the <code>10.0.0.0/24</code> network and set the default route to
<code>10.0.0.1</code>.

<p>
For convenience, you may wish to set up a
<a href="faq6.html#DHCP">DHCP server</a> on <code>vport0</code>.

<h3>Option 4 - VMs on the real network</h3>

In this scenario, the VM interface will be bridged with the same
network as the host. The VM can then be configured as if it were
physically connected to the host network.
This option only works for hosts with Ethernet connectivity, as the
IEEE 802.11 standard prevents wireless interfaces from participating
in network bridges.

<p>
The Ethernet network will be switched between the real network, the
host, and the VM using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/veb">veb(4)</a>.
Because veb(4) disconnects interfaces added as ports from the IP
stack, any IP configuration on the real interface has to be moved
to a <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vport">vport(4)</a> interface
for the host to be able to participate in the network.
In this example <code>em0</code> is the interface connected to the
real network.

<p>
Move the IP configuration from <code>em0</code> to <code>vport0</code>:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>mv /etc/hostname.em0 /etc/hostname.vport0</b>
# <b>echo up >> /etc/hostname.vport0</b>
# <b>echo up >> /etc/hostname.em0</b>
# <b>sh /etc/netstart em0 vport0</b>
</pre>

<p>
Create the <code>veb0</code> interface and add the <code>em0</code>
and <code>vport0</code> interfaces:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>cat &lt;&lt;END > /etc/hostname.veb0
add em0
add vport0
up
END</b>
# <b>sh /etc/netstart veb0</b>
</pre>

As done in the previous example, create or modify the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vm.conf">vm.conf(5)</a> file to ensure
that a virtual switch is defined:

<pre class="cmdbox">
switch "my_switch" {
    interface veb0
}

vm "my_vm" {
    ...
    interface { switch "my_switch" }
}
</pre>

The <code>my_vm</code> guest can now participate on the real network as if it
were physically connected.
<p>

<b>Note:</b> If the host interface (<code>em0</code> in the above
example) uses automatic address configuration (eg, DHCP), it may
rely on the MAC address of the interface to get a particular IP
address assigned. In this situation the MAC address from <code>em0</code>
can be assigned to <code>vport0</code> so it can use it on the real
network.

<p>
Virtual machines can be connected to a real network but isolated
from the host by omitting the vport interface in the configuration
above.
