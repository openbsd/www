Following -current and using snapshots

<hr>

<p>
Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.

<p>
Aggressive changes are sometimes pushed in this branch, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a> before using -current
and the instructions below.

<p>
In general, it's far easier to use snapshots, as developers will have gone
through much of the trouble for you already.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
-current.
This process typically consists of running
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> with the
<code>-s</code> flag.
Alternatively, download (and verify) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, boot from it,
and choose <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
Any installed packages should then be
<a href="faq15.html#PkgUpdate">upgraded</a> after booting into the new system.

<p>
Upgrading to -current by compiling your own source code is discouraged
for everyone except for experts, as difficult build-time crossing-points
can occur often, and no assistance will be provided.  In case of failure,
use a snapshot to recover.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.

<h3 id="r20251116">2025/11/16 - 52-partition ABI change</h3>

<b>struct disklabel</b> is changing in preparation for supporting
52 partitions rather than the 16 partition limit.  Building through
this is not trivial and requires the following conservative steps:

<ol>
<pre>
cp /usr/src/etc/rc /etc/rc               # to be safe
cp /usr/src/etc/etc.ARCH/MAKEDEV /dev

# place some sort of newish bsd.rd for recovery purposes

cd /usr/src && make includes
cd /usr/src/lib/libc && make && make install
cd /usr/src/lib/libutil && make && make install

cd /usr/src/sbin && make && make install

# With new disklabel command installed, verify that "disklabel sd0" fails
# with an error.  It should give an error, because it is issuing an ioctl
# for the large partition table

cp /bsd /bsd.save
cd /sys/arch/ARCH/compile/GENERIC && make && make install

cd /dev && sh MAKEDEV all
reboot
</pre>
</ol>

This hopefully works.

<h3 id="r20251023">2025/10/23 - OpenBSD/luna88k compiler switch</h3>

The <a href="../luna88k.html">OpenBSD/luna88k</a> port has switched compiler
from gcc 3.3.6 to gcc 4.2.1. Update using a snapshot is highly recommended. To
update from source, the following steps are needed:

<ol>
<li>
Install new Makefile machinery.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>cd /usr/src/share/mk && make install</b>
</pre>

<li>
Build and install the new compiler.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.bin/cc && su build -c 'exec make' && make install</b>
</pre>

<li>
Build and install the preprocessor.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>cd /usr/src/usr.bin/cpp && su build -c 'exec make' && make install</b>
</pre>

<li>
Rebuild the system as usual.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>cd /usr/src && make build</b>
</pre>

</ol>
