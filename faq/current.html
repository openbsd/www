Following -current and using snapshots

<p>
Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.

<p>
Aggressive changes are sometimes pushed in this branch, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a> before using -current
and the instructions below.

<p>
In general, it's far easier to use snapshots, as developers will have gone
through much of the trouble for you already.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
-current.
This process typically consists of running
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> with the
<code>-s</code> flag.
Alternatively, download (and verify) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, boot from it,
and choose <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
Any installed packages should then be
<a href="faq15.html#PkgUpdate">upgraded</a> after booting into the new system.

<p>
Upgrading to -current by compiling your own source code is discouraged
for everyone except for experts, as difficult build-time crossing-points
can occur often, and no assistance will be provided.  In case of failure,
use a snapshot to recover.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20250611">2025/06/11 - update to clang 19</h3>

Before building the system from source, make sure <code>/etc/login.conf</code>
is up to date, then change the <code>build</code> user's login class:

<pre class="cmdbox">
# <b>sysmerge</b>
# <b>id -c build</b>
default
# <b>user mod -L build build</b>
</pre>


<h3 id="r20250716">2025/07/16 - opaque stdio</h3>

The struct underlying <code>FILE</code> was made opaque and many base
libraries had a major bump.
<p>
<em>Cross these bumps using a snapshot.</em>
<p>
If you must build from source,
run <code><b>make includes</b></code>,
then build and install each one of <code>libc</code>, <code>libcurses</code>,
<code>libcrypto</code>, and <code>libssl</code> before building a
snapshot as usual.


<h3 id="r20250827">2025/08/27 - [packages] mongodb/unifi</h3>

MongoDB 4.4 can no longer be built following an update of libc++.
At the present time, a port of 8.0 is being worked on, but errors
out at startup.
For now, you might like to avoid updating machines running mongodb
(including those running the unifi management software).

<p>
MongoDB 8.0 will not be able to read database files from 4.4 so,
when available, you will need to dump and restore the database
(mongodump with 4.4 installed and running, then mongorestore with
8.0 installed and running; the pkg-readme file for unifi has some
notes), or for unifi you can backup from inside unifi, then
you'll later need to clean the database directory and restore
from the backup.


<h3 id="20250911">2025/09/11 - [packages] rbw</h3>

Beginning in OpenBSD 7.8, support for Yubico OTP authentication has been
removed. You must add or use a different authenticator which doesn't rely on
OTP functionality prior to adding or synchronizing an account.
