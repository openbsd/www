Following -current and using snapshots

<hr>

<p>
Active OpenBSD development is known as the
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">-current</a> branch.
These sources are frequently compiled into releases known as <i>snapshots</i>.

<p>
Aggressive changes are sometimes pushed in this branch, and complications can
arise when building the latest code or upgrading from a previous point in time.
Some of the steps for getting over these hurdles are explained on this page.
Make sure you've read and understand how to
<a href="faq5.html">build the system from source</a> before using -current
and the instructions below.

<p>
In general, it's far easier to use snapshots, as developers will have gone
through much of the trouble for you already.

<p>
You should <b>always</b> use a snapshot as the starting point for running
-current.
This process typically consists of running
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysupgrade">sysupgrade(8)</a> with the
<code>-s</code> flag.
Alternatively, download (and verify) the appropriate
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> file from the <code>/snapshots/</code>
directory of your preferred <a href="../ftp.html">mirror</a>, boot from it,
and choose <code>(U)pgrade</code> at the prompt.
Any installed packages should then be
<a href="faq15.html#PkgUpdate">upgraded</a> after booting into the new system.

<p>
Upgrading to -current by compiling your own source code is discouraged
for everyone except for experts, as difficult build-time crossing-points
can occur often, and no assistance will be provided.  In case of failure,
use a snapshot to recover.

<p>
Most of these changes will have to be performed as root.


<h3 id="r20241122">2024/11/22 - [packages] PostgreSQL major update</h3>

<p>
There was a major update to PostgreSQL 17.2.
Use <tt>pg_upgrade</tt> as described in the
<a href="https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/ports/databases/postgresql/pkg/README-server?rev=1.37&amp;content-type=text/plain">postgresql-server pkg-readme</a>
or do a dump/restore.


<h3 id="r20241124">2024/11/24 - [packages] minio server: Removal of Gateway and filesystem modes</h3>

<p>
The MinIO Gateway and the related filesystem mode entered a feature freeze in
July 2020. In February 2022, MinIO announced the deprecation of the MinIO
Gateway. Along with the deprecation announcement, MinIO also announced that the
feature would be removed in six months time.

<p>
The MinIO port has been update to a version where the MinIO Gateway and the
related filesystem mode code have been removed.  Deployments still using the
standalone or filesystem MinIO modes that upgrade to that latest version will
fail to start.

<p>
The last MinIO version supporting the filesystem mode (0.20221024) is still
available as a package. If you "pkg_add minio" you'll be offered a choice of
versions.

The upstream project provides a
<a href="https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/operations/install-deploy-manage/migrate-fs-gateway.html">
  procedure to migrate to a new Single-Node Single-Drive deployment
</a>.


<h3 id="r20241216">2024/12/16 - [packages] courier-imap: removed -noidentlookup option</h3>

<p>
On courier-imap and courier-pop3, -noidentlookup option has been removed, configuration files
must be adjusted accordingly.
</p>


<h3 id="r20241218">2024/12/18 - [packages] ttyd: changed to read-only by default</h3>

<p>
ttyd has changed from the web-presented terminal being writable by default,
to being read-only. If you require it to accept user input, use the -W flag.
</p>


<h3 id="r20250127">2025/01/27 - [perl] PerlIO::scalar no longer an XS module</h3>

<p>
Perl has been updated to 5.40.1 and some files are no longer included
and can be removed.

<pre class="cmdbox">
# rm -rf /usr/libdata/perl5/*/PerlIO/scalar.pm \
         /usr/libdata/perl5/*/auto/PerlIO/scalar<!--
--></pre>
</p>


<h3 id="r20240930">2024/09/30 - [packages] MariaDB update</h3>

<p>
MariaDB was updated to the 11.4 branch. Binary logs are no longer purged
by default unless a replica has connected. If you don't use replication,
either set <code>slave_connections_needed_for_purge=0</code> in the
<code>[mysqld]</code> section of <code>/etc/my.cnf</code>, or disable
binary logs.


<h3 id="r20250313">2025/03/13 - sshd update</h3>

<p>
After "make install" in /usr/src/usr.bin/ssh run "rcctl restart sshd".
Otherwise sshd terminates and you cannot login anymore.
