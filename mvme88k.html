OpenBSD/mvme88k is an effort to port OpenBSD to the systems built upon
Motorola's 881x0-based VME motherboard family.

<p>
A mailing list for m88k-based ports is available at
<u><font color="#23238e">m88k@openbsd.org</font></u>.
To join the OpenBSD/m88k mailing list, send a message body of

The current port maintainer is Miod Vallat
(<a href="mailto:miod@openbsd.org">miod@openbsd.org</a>), with the help of
Steve Murphree. Others are definitely welcome to contribute!

<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>History:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
The Motorola 88k processor is said to be the best RISC processor ever 
devised.  Its simplicity and elegance combine to make the mvme88k a 
hearty, robust platform. 

<p>
Nivas Madhur started the initial mvme88k port for the MVME187 card, but
has since moved on to another employer.  
The port was brought in the OpenBSD tree by Dale Rahn, but he did not
have enough time to work on it.
Steve Murphree, Jr. eventually completed the port to the MVME187 in
November 1998.

<p>
Unfortunately, at the same time, a compiler upgrade from gcc 2.8.1 to
egcs revealed a lot of problems in the mvme88k support in gcc, which
could not be fixed in time for mvme88k to be a supported OpenBSD 2.5
release.

<p>
The lack of an in-tree toolchain did not prevent further work on the port,
and a lot of changes were made to the codebase, such as revamped autoconf
and on-board SCSI driver, greatly expanded VME bus support, working install
process that correctly creates a Motorola VID block on the disks,
and support for MVME188 as well as improving support for MVME197.

<p>
During summer 2003, an effort to fix the toolchain eventually produced a
working gcc 2.95 compiler, and allowed the port to be self-hosting again.
With the help of Mark Kettenis, the toolchain effort eventually produced
working binutils and gdb in late may 2004.

<p>
Work towards multiprocessor support on the MVME188 boards started in
summer 2005 and, after a lot of tedious bugfixing, was eventually
completed shortly after the 4.2 release in november 2007.

<p>
The next step was getting the 88110-based MVME197 designs to work.
Single-processor kernels started to run reliably in december 2007.

<a name="status"></a>
<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>Current status:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
Currently, MVME187, MVME188 and MVME197 boards, as well as similar
designs, are booting multi-user, supporting most of the on-board devices.
There are still a few caveats; depending on your exact hardware setup,
your mileage may vary.
Work is on progress to fix the remaining problems.

<hr>
<a name="projects"></a>
<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>Projects (in no particular order):
</strong></font></h3>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>MVME197DP multi-processor support.
  <li>Work on unsupported device cards (MVME327, MVME374...).
  <li>Write code for new binutils (and gdb), switch to ELF and, later,
      shared libraries.
</ul>

<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>Supported hardware:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
<h4>Supported processor boards</h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MVME187</strong><br>
A single 88100 processor-based version of the <a href="mvme68k.html">mvme68k</a>
MVME167 and MVME177 boards. Features two 88200 CMMUs with 16KB cache
each, SRAM, and on-board ethernet and SCSI controllers, as well as four serial
ports and one parallel port.<br>
<li><strong>MVME188 and MVME188A</strong><br>
Contrary to the other MVME processor boards, this board has no on-board
devices; it just acts as a container for an <i>HYPERmodule</i> which provides
one, two or four 88100 processors, and two or four 88200 (16KB cache) or 88204
(64KB cache) CMMUs per processor.<br>
All HYPERmodules combinations are supported, but M88200 1P128 and 1P512 have
not been tested.<br>
External cards specific to the MVME188 family provide memory and serial ports.
<br>
Multi-processor kernels are supported on these boards in <tt>-CURRENT</tt>.
<li><strong>MVME197LE</strong><br>
An entry-level design similar to the MVME187, but based on the 88110 processor
with integrated MMU and cache controller.<br>
These boards are supported in <tt>-CURRENT</tt>.
<li><strong>MVME197SP and MVME197DP</strong><br>
Improved versions of the MVME197LE, with one (SP) or two (DP) 88110 processors,
and one 88410 external cache controller per processor.<br>
These boards are supported in <tt>-CURRENT</tt> with single-processor
kernels only so far.
</ul>

<p>
Besides various Motorola complete systems (<strong>M8120</strong>,
MVME187-based <strong>series 900</strong>, etc), this port also runs on the
MVME187-based <strong>Triton Dolphin System 100</strong>.

<p>
<h4>Supported on-board devices</h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MVME187 and MVME197</strong>

  <li>Intel 82596CA Ethernet interface
(<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ie&amp;sektion=4&amp;arch=mvme88k">ie</a>)
  <li>NCR53c710 SCSI Controller
(<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=osiop&amp;sektion=4&amp;arch=mvme88k">osiop</a>)
  <li>128KB SRAM (/dev/sram0)
  <li>8KB NVRAM (/dev/nvram0)
  </ul>
</li>

<p>
<h4>Supported VME boards</h4>

<p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MVME328</strong> High Performance SCSI Controller
(<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=vs&amp;sektion=4&amp;arch=mvme88k">vs</a>)
  <li><strong>MVME332XT</strong> High Performance Serial I/O Controller
	(8 serial ports, 1 parallel port) (vx)
  <li><strong>MVME376</strong> Ethernet Communications Controller
(<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=le&amp;sektion=4&amp;arch=mvme88k">le</a>)
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Unsupported processor boards</h4>
<p>

<p>
These boards are currently not supported. There is nothing, apart from lack
of availabile hardware, preventing them from being supported eventually.
<ul>
<li><strong>MVME180 <i>``Angelfire''</i> and MVME181</strong><br>
A low-cost, entry level board, featuring a single 88100 processor, two 88200
CMMUs and two on-board serial ports.
</ul>

<p>
As VME hardware is quite uncommon in the average retail place, and Motorola
881x0-based hardware is even more rare, this section is here to satisfy the
well-founded curiosity about the mvme88k hardware.

<p>
A comprehensive reference about the m88k processor and the various designs
built upon it is being gathered by Paul Weissmann at
<a href="http://badabada.org/">badabada</a>.
