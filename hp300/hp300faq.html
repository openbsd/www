<h2><a name="netboot">H.1 - Can OpenBSD/hp300 boot across the network?</a></h2>
HP 9000/300-series workstations support network booting with
Boot ROM Revision B or later.  (This includes any Boot ROM with a numeric
revision). The HP Boot ROM uses the
<b>HP Remote Maintenance Protocol</b> to download the boot code
from the server.  The server must run a daemon capable of responding
to HP RMP boot requests, <i><a 
href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=rbootd&amp;sektion=8">rbootd(8)</a></i>.
<p>
To set up your OpenBSD/hp300 workstation, follow the 
<i><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=diskless&amp;sektion=8">diskless(8)</a></i> man page.

<p>
<h2><a name="term">H.2 - What <tt>TERM</tt> type is needed for the console?</a></h2>
If you're using a local console, and you're running csh or tcsh, you'll
need to make sure you run:
<pre>setenv TERM vt220</pre>
Otherwise many things won't work, including vi.

<p>
<h2><a name="x11">H.3 - What is the situation with X11 on the hp300?</a></h2>
We currently have the complete X11R6 clients and server from X.org.
It is not possible to run HP-UX X11R5 server under emulation anymore.

<p>
<h2><a name="unexpected_use_of">H.4 - What does 'UNEXPECTED USE OF FFFFFFC4' mean?</a></h2>
This is the output of one of a set of temporary, informational only,
exception handlers installed by the Boot ROM before an OS has been loaded.
The address printed varies depending on the type of exception.
The most likely cause here is trying to boot a kernel that is incompatible
with the hardware.  You will get something like this, for example, if you
attempt to boot an HP-UX 7.0 or earlier kernel on a 68040 machine
(which requires at least 7.05).  If you're going to install OpenBSD, you
probably don't need to worry about this message, though it is possible (but
unlikely) that it indicates hardware trouble or a corrupt bootloader.

<hr>
<h2>Boot ROM Information</h2>
<hr>

<p>
<h2><a name="bootrom">H.5 - What commands does the HP Boot ROM understand?</a></h2>
All the early hp300 Boot ROMs are very primitive and only allow a few
simple operations.  You can only interact with it after it is first
powered on -- if you reboot the machine, it will ignore anything you type
and start loading the same OS you previously booted.
<p>
At any time after it recognizes the keyboard, while it is doing its self
test or searching for a
bootable system, you can hit <tt>reset</tt> to return it to a cold-boot
configuration.  On HIL keyboards, this is
<tt>&lt;control&gt;-&lt;shift&gt;-break</tt>,
where <tt>break</tt> is the key in the upper left (where escape is on sane
keyboards).  There is no equivalent over serial terminal -- you'll need to
power-cycle your machine.
<p>
After it beeps (i.e. recognizes the HIL keyboard), press
<tt>&lt;return&gt;</tt> twice to get the list of bootable devices.
To perform simple hardware checks, hit <tt>&lt;control&gt;-C</tt> before
it starts booting an OS.  You can then type <tt>T</tt> to perform an
extended self test or <tt>L</tt> to perform the extended self test
infinitely until it finds a fatal error or <tt>L</tt> is typed again.
<p>
The newer HP Boot ROM, present on Series 400 machines and some of
the later 300s (345, 375, 380, 382, 385) is capable of a little bit more.
To select which device to boot from, press <tt>&lt;return&gt;</tt> once,
after it
beeps twice (i.e. recognizes the HIL keyboard).  To get to a configuration
and test menu, press:
<pre>
   C &lt;return&gt;
</pre>
This will allow you to configure interrupt levels, select codes, and
serial console properties.  You can also hit <tt>&lt;control&gt;-C</tt> to
get to a menu of extended tests with several fancy options.
<p>
For more information, Michael Wolfson has scanned in parts of the 
<a href="http://www.blobulent.com/hp300/400.manual">HP Apollo 9000
Series 400 HP-UX Owner's Guide</a>, which has some good
information on this topic.
<p>

<p>
<h2><a name="bootsearch">H.6 - What order does the Boot ROM use to search for bootable devices?</a></h2>
From the <i>Configuration Reference Manual</i>, 98561-90020:

<h3>Revision A Boot ROM Specifications</h3>
The boot ROM can load a ROM system or a file from a LIF or SRM
"SYSTEM" type file having a name of the form SYSa, where "a" is typically
an ASCII letter, but may be any character legal in a file name.
<p>
ROM systems are assigned a single letter ID (only "B", for BASIC, is
presently supported on Series 300).
<p>
All system files found are assigned an ID of the form "nna", where "a" is
either the same letter "a" mentioned above (if an ASCII letter), or "Z"
(if not an ASCII letter).  "nn" is a number of the form " 1" to "99"
denoting the order of occurrence of systems which result in the same ID
letter "a".  The range of system IDs is " 1A" to "99Z".
<p>
The boot ROM loads the first system found unless characters (other than
that system's ID) are typed on the boot control keyboard (see below).  The
search order used by the boot ROM is:
<p>
<ul><li>For select codes 7 thru 31: disc or tape (HPIB) at bus address 0,
unit 0, volume 0
<li>SRM at select code 21, node 0, volume 8, "/SYSTEMS" directory
<li>98259A Bubble system at select code 30
<li>98255 EPROM "disc"-type system at unit 0 (lowest address of all 98255s installed)
<li>ROM systems (from lowest to highest ROM address)
<li>For select codes 0 thru 31, bus addresses 0 to 7, units 0 to 16,
volumes 0 to 7: all remaining discs or tapes (HPIB)
<li>For select codes 0 thru 31, nodes 1 thru 62, volumes 1 to 50: any
other SRM system files in "/SYSTEMS" directories
<li>For select codes 0 thru 29, and 31: remaining 98255 Bubble systems
<li>Remaining 98255 "disc"-type EPROM units.
</ul>
<p>

Revision B and later also support booting over the network, using a 98643
card or built-in ethernet.  
For older systems, the best choice is to make your boot drive on HPIB at
address 0.  Remember, you'll need to capitalize the letters.
<p>
<h3>Newer Boot ROM Search Order</h3>
The newer machines (Models 345, 375, 380, 382, 385, and Series 400) have a
different boot order. From <i>HP Apollo 9000 Series 400 HP-UX Owner's
Guide</i>, A1630-90006:
<p>
<cite>The Scan for Systems selection searches mass storage devices for an
operating system to boot.  The first mass storage device found with an
HP-UX Compatible operating system on it boots.  Mass storage devices are
searched by the priority shown in this table.</cite>

<p>
So, for these newer systems, your best bet is to make your boot drive a
SCSI drive at address 6 (7 is the system controller on the motherboard).
<p>
It is also possible to configure the Boot ROM to default to a specific
device from the configuration menu.
<p>

<p>
<h2><a name="domain">H.7 - Switching your Series 400 machine from Domain to "HP-UX Compatible Boot Mode"</a></h2>
This step is necessary, since OpenBSD can only
boot a Series 400 machine when it's set up in "HP-UX Compatible Boot
Mode".  If, when you power on your machine, it does <b>not</b> present a
menu as follows, then you need to follow the instructions below:
<pre>

HP-HIL.Keyboard
[...]</pre>

First, you'll need either a Domain keyboard or a HIL keyboard (the Boot
ROM knows how to use either, even if OpenBSD doesn't yet).
Now, put your machine into "service mode".  For a 4XXs, there's a toggle
switch on the back of the machine (near the top).  For a 4XXt or 4XXdl,
there's a green button on the front, behind the silly door.  For a 425e,
there's a toggle switch on the back of the machine (in the middle).
Once you're in "service mode", the other
green LED will light up.  Reset the machine. You may then need to hit
return to get the Domain boot prompt.  At that prompt, you can type
<tt><b>H</b></tt> to get a list of available commands.  You need to type
the following things to convert to HP-UX mode:

<pre><b>CF
2
2
P
E</b></pre>
<a href="domain.commands.html">This</a> is the full procedure captured
from a serial console.
<p>
Be sure to turn <b>off</b> "service mode" when you're done.  I found it
prevented me from selecting which device I wanted to boot from.
</p>

<h2><a name="bootrom2">H.9 - Where could I get a more recent Boot ROM for my 400s or 400t?</a></h2>
Michael Wolfson has images of the HP 425/433 Boot ROM in HP-UX mode.
This is necessary when upgrading a 400 to a 425/433.

<h2><a name="serialconsole">H.10 - Setting up a serial console on a 98561, 98562, 98626, 98628, 98642, or 98644</a></h2>
Turn off power to your system before removing any cards.  Remove the
card with the serial interface.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b><tt>98561-66530</tt></b> (Human Interface)<br>
   Locate the bank of 4 DIP switches<br>
   One of them should be labeled REM<br>
   Set the switch to ?<br>
<li><b><tt>98562</tt></b> (System Interface)<br>
   Locate the middle bank of DIP switches (4 switches)<br>
   The third switch is labeled REM<br>
   Set the switch to one (depress the end labeled one)<br>
   <i>Note: you need a non-null cable</i>
<li><b><tt>98626</tt></b> (dca)<br>
   Locate the jumper by the two banks of DIP switches<br>
   Remove the jumper<br>
<li><b><tt>98628</tt></b> (dcl)<br>
   Locate the bank of DIP switches by the card-edge connector<br>
   The last switch (labeled 7) is the remote switch<br>
   Set the switch to zero (depress the end labeled zero)
<li><b><tt>98642</tt></b> (dcm)<br>
   Locate the 8 DIP switches<br>
   The first switch (labeled 1) is the remote switch<br>
   Set the switch to one (slide the bump to one)<br>
   <i>Note:  According to the manual, the Boot ROM on older machines
    does not know how to use this for console, but OpenBSD (and HP-UX)
    will, so you won't see anything until the bootloader loads.</i>
<li><b><tt>98644</tt></b> (dca)<br>
   Locate the 10 DIP switches<br>
   The last switch (labeled 1) is the remote switch<br>
   Set the switch to one (depress the end labeled one)<br>
</ul>
<p>
Now, reinsert the card and power on your machine.  All console messages
will be sent over the serial port at 
9600 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.  Theoretically, you should be
using a null-modem cable, but I found that for my 98562, I needed a
non-null modem cable.

<p>
<h2><a name="serialconsole340">H.11 - Setting up serial console on a Model 340</a></h2>
Turn off power to your system<br>
There are four DIP switches visible through the rear panel<br>
Flip the third switch from the left to one<br>
Turn on your system
<p>
Now, all console messages will be sent over the serial port at 9600 bps,
8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.
</p>

<p>
<h2><a name="serialconsole400">H.12 - Setting up serial console on a Series 400 machine or a 345,375, 380, 382, or 385</a></h2>
Wait until your system beeps twice (this is to let
you know it's
recognized the keyboard).  Type <tt><b>C&lt;return&gt;</b></tt> and wait
until the configuration menu shows up.  Then type in the following set of
commands:
<pre><b>1
5
3
R
X
N</b></pre>
<p>
<i>(If your machine does not have an HP-IB controller, replace <b>5</b> with
<b>4</b> in the instructions above)</i>
<p>
<a href="serialconsole.html">This</a> is the full procedure captured from
a serial console on my 400s.  It may be slightly different for the 300
series machines (345, 375, 380, 382, 385).
<p>
Note that the 425e does not support serial console setup in the ROM.
However, since the 425e's SGC graphics are not supported as a console
under OpenBSD, the serial console (on apci0) is the only possibility and
thus no ROM setting is required.
<p>
Now, your machine will  reset and then send all console messages over the
serial port at
9600 bps, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.  Use a null-modem cable.
<p>
If you want to convert from serial console to monitor/keyboard console,
follow the same procedure, except type <tt><b>L</b></tt> instead of
<tt><b>R</b></tt>.
<p>
You may also <i>temporarily</i> override this setting by typing
<tt><b>L&lt;return&gt;</b></tt> or <tt><b>R&lt;return&gt;</b></tt> after
your system beeps twice and recognizes the keyboard.  This will work even
if you have a Domain keyboard.

<p>
Since the serial console will be mapped to <tt>/dev/console</tt>, you
do <b>not</b> add an entry in <tt>/etc/ttys</tt>.  You just need to
verify that the <tt>/etc/ttys</tt> line for <tt>/dev/console</tt> is
marked as being <b>on</b>.  You probably want to change the terminal
type from <em>vt220</em> to <em>vt100</em> or whatever terminal type
you will be connecting to it.

<p>
<h2><a name="serialsplit">H.13 - How do I build the cable to get at the hidden serial ports on a Series 400 machine?</a></h2>
Build the funky <!-- <a href="serial.splitter.html"> --> three-way splitter
cable.<!-- </a> --> 
Otherwise, a normal DB25 serial cable will work fine if you only 
want one serial port.
<br>
Note that a splitter is not needed for the 425e,
on which the three serial ports are already broken out on the back panel.

<p>This table gives the pinout for the serial connector on the rear panel.<br>
