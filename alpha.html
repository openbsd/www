<h3 id="history"><strong>History:</strong></h3>

<p>
The OpenBSD/alpha port was started in the summer of 1996 by using code
from the NetBSD/alpha port which was started by
<a href="mailto:cgd@netbsd.org">Chris Demetriou</a> in 1994.
After the original OpenBSD port, some
copyright issues prevented OpenBSD from tracking the NetBSD code.
Regardless, work on the alpha port continued and many fixes were made.
Meanwhile, NetBSD continued to make improvements to the
alpha port which we were unfortunately unable to use.  Over time,
because of a lack of programmer resources and the inability to use
NetBSD code, hardware and software support became very outdated.  This
caused the 2.5 and 2.6 releases of alpha to have few kernel
enhancements.  As a result of its becoming so stale, there was no
OpenBSD/alpha port included in the 2.7 and 2.8 releases.

<p>
Shortly after OpenBSD 2.8 was released, there was a great deal of
interest in bringing the port up to date.  This, coupled with the fact
that NetBSD changed the license on its alpha code so that there were no
longer copyright issues led to an effort to bring the alpha port
back up. (For details on why we were not able to keep tracking the
NetBSD code, check our <a href="policy.html">policy</a> page.)

<p>
Nathan Binkert, Art Grabowski, Niklas Hallqvist and Eric Jackson, with
the help of a few others, eventually brought the port into good shape
again, and starting with the 2.9 release OpenBSD/alpha is a supported
OpenBSD port again.

<h3 id="status"><strong>Current status:</strong></h3>

<p>
Currently, all the hardware listed in the
<a href="#hardware">supported hardware</a> section below boots
multi-user, and supports enough of the on-board devices to be generally
usable, unless specified otherwise.
A large set of PCI cards also work reliably, while ISA devices support has
limitations.

<p>
X11 server support is currently broken on alpha.

<h3 id="hardware"><strong>Supported hardware:</strong></h3>

<p>
To the best of our knowledge, the following hardware is supported, but there
might be occasional breakage on some models.
Since there are many models and combinations that have not been tested,
we would appreciate very much if you told us about things that work and
do not work.
To help us keep track of what hardware people use, please mail your dmesg to
<a href="mailto:dmesg@openbsd.org">dmesg@openbsd.org</a>.
If there are things that do not work, please file a bug report using
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/alpha/sendbug.1">
sendbug(1)</a>.
