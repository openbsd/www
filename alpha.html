<h3><font color="#0000e0">History and Status:</font></h3>

<p>The OpenBSD/alpha port was begun in the summer of 1996 by using code
from the NetBSD/alpha port which was begun by Chris Demetriou
&lt;cgd@netbsd.org&gt; in 1994.  After the original OpenBSD port, some
copyright issues prevented OpenBSD from tracking the NetBSD code.
Regardless, work on the alpha port continued and many fixes were made.
While we were making fixes, NetBSD continued to make improvements to the
alpha port which we were unfortunately unable to use.  Over time,
because of a lack of programmer resources and the inability to use
NetBSD code, hardware and software support became very outdated.  This
caused the 2.5 and 2.6 releases of alpha to have few kernel
enhancements.  As a result of its becoming so stale, alpha was not
included in the 2.7 and 2.8 releases.</p>

<p>Shortly after 2.8 was released, there has been a great deal of
interest in bringing the port up to date.  This coupled with the fact
that NetBSD changed the license on its alpha code so that there are no
longer copyright issues has lead to an effort to bring the alpha port
back up. (For details on why we were not able to keep tracking the
NetBSD code, check our <a href="policy.html">policy</a> page.)</p>

<p>Nate Binkert, Art Grabowski, Niklas Hallqvist and Eric Jackson, with
the help of a few others, eventually brought the port in good shape
again, and starting with the 2.9 release alpha is a major OpenBSD port
again.</p>

<p>However, there is currently no maintainer for the alpha port.
Technical discussion about the alpha port should be directed to <a
href="mailto:alpha@openbsd.org">&lt;alpha@openbsd.org&gt;</a>.  If you
are at all interested in development of the alpha port, please send
inquiries to this address.  If you are interested in the job of alpha
port maintainer, help out the project for a while and step up to the
job.</p>

<h3><font color="#0000e0">Projects (in no particular order):</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>Testing more platforms and peripherals, to find what issues are
remaining and improve overall stability
<li>Better documentation
<li>compat_osf1 shared libs
<li>bus_dma on more core chipsets
<li>isa_dma
<li>Floppy support (needs isa_dma first)
<li>Fix 64-bit issues in the non-working PCI drivers
<li>Improve TGA support to include virtual consoles
<li>Improve X11 support
</ul>


<h3><font color="#0000e0">Install media:</font></h3>
A number of install options exist:
<ul>
<li><strong>CD boot:</strong><p>
Booting off the CD provides an El Torito 2.88MB floppy image that
contains drivers for the most popular devices found in alpha hardware.
This also includes minimal USB support (storage devices, keyboard and
some ethernet adapters).<br>
For the latest list of drivers available on this image, take a look at
the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/sys/arch/alpha/conf/RAMDISKBIG?rev=HEAD">
RAMDISKBIG</a> config file.<p>
<li><strong>Floppy A:</strong><p>
This 1.44MB floppy image supports the following alpha hardware:
<ul>
<li>AlphaStation 200, 250, 255, 400
<li>AlphaStation 500, 600
<li>AlphaServer 800, 1000 and 1000A
<li>AXPpci33 based machines, such as the ``Noname'', UDB, and Multia
<li>EB164 based machines, such as the PC164, 164SX and 164LX
<li>Personal Workstation (Miata)
</ul><br>
It contains support for the on-board devices found on these machines,
however due to lack of place there are only few other drivers. In
particular, this floppy lacks cdrom support and won't allow you to
install from cdrom media.<p>
<li><strong>Floppy B:</strong><p>
This 1.44MB floppy image supports the following alpha hardware:
<ul>
<li>Alpha Processor, Inc. UP1000
<li>XP1000, 264DP, DS10, and DS20
</ul>
It contains support for the on-board devices found on these machines,
however due to lack of place there are only few other drivers. In
particular, this floppy lacks cdrom support and won't allow you to
install from cdrom media.<p>
</ul>
<p>
Use the method that works best for you.


<h3><font color="#0000e0">Supported Hardware:</font></h3>

<p>Because of the changes that are currently being made to alpha, the
currently supported hardware is in flux.  To the best of our knowledge,
the following hardware is supported, but there might be occasional
breakage on some models.  Since there are many models and combinations
that we have not tested, we would appreciate very much if you told us
about things that work and do not work.  To help us keep track of what
hardware people use, please mail your dmesg to
<a href="mailto:dmesg@openbsd.org">&lt;dmesg@openbsd.org&gt;</a>.  If
there are things that do not work, please file a bug report using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sendbug&amp;sektion=1">sendbug(1)</a>.</p>
