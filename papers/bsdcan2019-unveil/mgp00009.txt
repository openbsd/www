Unveil can affect program behavior

This is different from pledge(2)
     (when you break a pledge, your program is dead)

 -What gets returned makes programs change behaviors!
 -This can be scary, strange, or even amusing.

Early on we saw the need for the ENOENT vs EACCES distinction so programs behave "normally"
