The clever attacker

finds a bug

understands the unintended side-effects created

because of the strict regularity of the system environment

... and crafts an exploit which grants him advantage.

It is high time for defensive technologies which make it
harder to write an exploit.  Recent developments in OpenBSD
make the system environment much more hostile towards
exploitation, without impacting well-behaving processes.
