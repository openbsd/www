W^X - The Mechanism


Depends on MMU Architecture:

sparc sparc64 alpha
amd64 ia64 hppa          per-page X bit
i386                     code segment limit, or PAE NX
powerpc                  per-segment X bit
arm                      soft TLB management on some
m88k                     Split code & data mmu
vax m68k mips            not possible

OpenBSD currently has W^X on:

sparc sparc64 alpha amd64 hppa i386

Not implemented:

powerpc m88k ia64

We need a few process address space changes to support this...
