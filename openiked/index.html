<a href="https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenIKED/openiked-7.4-relnotes.txt">OpenIKED 7.4</a> released Apr 10th, 2025

<p>
OpenIKED is a <strong>FREE</strong> implementation of the Internet Key
Exchange (IKEv2) protocol which performs mutual authentication and which
establishes and maintains IPsec VPN security policies and associations
(SAs) between peers. The IKEv2 protocol is defined in RFC 5996, which
combines and updates the previous standards: ISAKMP/Oakley (RFC 2408),
IKE (RFC 2409), and the Internet DOI (RFC 2407). OpenIKED only supports
the IKEv2 protocol; support for ISAKMP/Oakley and IKEv1 is provided by
OpenBSD's <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/isakmpd.8">isakmpd(8)</a>
or other implementations on non-OpenBSD platforms.

<p>
It is intended to be a lean, clean, secure, better configurable and
interoperable implementation that focusses on supporting the main
standards and most important features of IKEv2.

<p>
OpenIKED is developed as part of <a href="https://www.openbsd.org">the
OpenBSD Project</a>. The software is freely usable and re-usable by
everyone under an ISC license.

<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/openiked/openiked-portable">portable
version</a> is available via periodic tarball releases. Contributions
are welcome to both the OpenIKED core and the portable build framework.

<p>
OpenIKED is developed entirely by volunteers.
Contributions to
<a href="https://www.openbsdfoundation.org">The OpenBSD Foundation</a>
support the development of this and other OpenBSD projects.
