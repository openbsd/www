<li><p><b>July 27, 2020</b><br>
    All versions of OpenIKED in OpenBSD through 6.7 were vulnerable to an
    authentication bypass due to incorrect use of the EVP_PKEY_cmp() function.
    <p>
    For more information see
    <a href=https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/6.7/common/014_iked.patch.sig>
    the OpenBSD source code patch.</a>
    <br>
    This bug is corrected in OpenBSD's current and stable branches. Binary updates
    for OpenBSD 6.6 and OpenBSD 6.7 can be obtained with the 
    <a href=https://man.openbsd.org/syspatch>syspatch(8)</a> utility.
