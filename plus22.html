<h2><font color="#e00000">Changes made between OpenBSD 2.1 and OpenBSD 2.2</font></h2>
<hr>

<p>
This is a partial list of the major machine independent changes
(ie. these are the changes people ask about most often).  Port
specific changes have also been made, and are sometimes mentioned
in the pages for the specific <a href=plat.html>ports</a> if you
are interested in further port-specific details.  Many ports
have had architecture-specific enhancements relative to NetBSD,
but when they do not they certainly have plenty of platform-independent
changes, starting with those listed below..

<p>
Note: <font color="#e00000">Problems for which patches exist are marked in red</font>.
