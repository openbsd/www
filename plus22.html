2.2 Changelog
</h2>
<hr>

<p>
This is a partial list of the major machine independent changes
(i.e., these are the changes people ask about most often).  Machine
specific changes have also been made, and are sometimes mentioned
in the pages for the specific <a href=plat.html>platforms</a> if you
are interested in further port-specific details.  Many ports
have had architecture-specific enhancements relative to NetBSD,
but when they do not they certainly have plenty of platform-independent
changes, starting with those listed below..

<p>
Note: <strong>Problems for which patches exist are marked in red</strong>.

<h3>Changes made between OpenBSD 2.1 and 2.2</h3>
<p>

<ul>
<li>Prevent open(2) with wrong flag modes.
<li><b>The new afterboot(8) man page. Everyone should look at this.</b>
<li>Addition of 'kbus' port for the Solbourne Series5 sparc-based machines.
<li>Make clri(8) mark the filesystem dirty.
<li>Add per-host locking support to supfilesrv.
<li>Make the ncr scsi driver work on big-endian machines too.
