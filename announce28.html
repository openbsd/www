<h1><font color="#0000e0">OpenBSD 2.8 RELEASED</font></h1>
<h2><font color="#0000e0">December 1, 2000</font></h2>

<p><font size="+2">
It is our pleasure to officially announce the release of 
<a href="28.html">OpenBSD 2.8</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">
Just over 6 weeks ago, on October 18, OpenBSD turned 5 years old.  In
celebration of this milestone, we invite you to enjoy our 8th release
on CDROM (and 9th via FTP).  We continue to celebrate OpenBSD's record
of three years without a remote hole in the default install.
</font>
</p>

<p><font size="+1">
Just like all of our previous releases, 2.8 provides significant improvements,
including new features, in nearly all areas of the system:
</font>
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hardware support is improved
(<a href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/plat.html">http://www.OpenBSD.org/plat.html</a>)
</strong>
<ul>
  <li>OpenBSD 2.8 will run on Apple iMac, G3, G4, and G4 Cube machines.

  <li>Improved hardware crypto support, now including Hifn PowerCrypt and
    Broadcom Bluesteelnet (uBsec) hardware accelerator boards.
  <li>Many new Ethernet devices supported, including National Semiconductor
    DP83815-based adapters, 3Com MiniPCI adapters, 3Com 574-based PCMCIA,
    and many new CardBus devices (Xircom, Intel 21143, Intel CardBus II).
  <li>Support for most of the Gigabit Ethernet cards on the market, i.e.,
    SysKonnect, Intel, and Alteon-based.
  <li>Support for most types of USB devices, including Ethernet, printers,
    audio, etc.  Sync your Handspring Visor, or transfer MP3's to your Rio.
  <li>Support for 3ware Escalade 3W-5x000 and 3W-6x000 series RAID controllers.
  <li>New audio support, including the Cirrus Logic CS4280, ForteMedia FM801,
    and integrated audio chips found on newer VIA and Intel motherboards.
  <li>Improvements and new support in the PCI IDE subsystem.
</ul>

<li><strong>Security has been further strengthened
(<a href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/security.html">http://www.OpenBSD.org/security.html</a>)
</strong>
 <ul>
  <li>In response to the threat posed by so-called "format string" bugs, OpenBSD
    performed a complete source tree audit in June to identify and correct
    such problems.  This involved countless hours of code reading and careful
    bug fixes.  We are confident that these issues have been solved and that
    once again our proactive security auditing process has proved itself an
    invaluable component of the OpenBSD philosophy.

  <li>Several other security issues dealt with across the system, many of which
    were identified by members of the OpenBSD team themselves.  Please see
    http://www.openbsd.org/errata27.html for more details on what was fixed.
 </ul>
 
<li><strong>Even more integrated cryptography 
(<a href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/crypto.html">http://www.OpenBSD.org/crypto.html</a>)
</strong>
 <ul>
  <li>OpenSSH has been improved, debugged, and is now at version 2.3.0.  Support
    for both SSH1 and SSH2 protocols ensures maximum interoperability with
    other implementations.  This version also includes an SFTP server for
    secure file transfers with several Windows-based clients.  Since OpenSSH
    is free, it has continued to gain acceptance on other operating systems
    as well.  For more information, see http://www.OpenSSH.com, or simply
    install OpenBSD 2.8 and try it out. Our sincerest thanks to Markus Friedl,
    one of our developers and the driving force behind OpenSSH.

  <li>The celebration continues.  What better birthday present for OpenBSD than
    the expiration of the RSA patent? SSL libraries now come as part of the
    base operating system install, permitting SSL and RSA applications to
    work normally without fancy installation tricks.  These applications now
    include httpd, isakmpd, and ssh.

  <li>Our already very mature IPSEC code has been enhanced to comply with
    the latest standard changes, i.e., AES.  Using IPSEC and bridging,
    Ethernets can be securely tunneled over the Internet.  The IKE isakmpd
    has become more robust and can be used in a configuration-less mode in
    conjunction with certificates.  IPSEC performance has improved for
    software cryptography, but with hardware crypto accelerators
    (including Hifn and Broadcom based encryption processors), incredibly
    fast IPSEC processing is possible.

  <li>Improving on the encryption of swap space introduced in the previous
    release, OpenBSD now uses Rijndael, the recently chosen AES encryption
    standard.
 </ul>
 
<li><strong>Many other bugs fixed 
(<a href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/plus28.html">http://www.OpenBSD.org/plus28.html</a>)
</strong>

<li><strong>The "ports" tree is greatly improved
(<a href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/ports.html">http://www.OpenBSD.org/ports.html</a>)
</strong>
 <ul>
  <li>The 2.8 CD ships with many more pre-built packages for the common
    architectures.  The FTP site contains hundreds more packages (for the
    important architectures) which we could not fit onto the CDs.  A list of
    those packages is appended below.
 </ul>
<li><strong>Many subsystems improved and updated since the last release</strong>
 <ul>
  <li>XFree86 3.3.6-current
  <li>gcc 2.95.3
  <li>perl 5.6.0 plus a few fixes.
  <li>Apache 1.3.12 (+ patches), Mod_ssl 2.6.2, OpenSSL 0.9.5a, DSO support
  <li>ipf 3.3.18
  <li>groff 1.15
  <li>sendmail 8.10.1
  <li>lynx 2.8.2 with HTTPS support added
  <li>sudo 1.6.3p5
  <li>ncurses 5.2
  <li>Latest KAME IPv6
  <li>KTH Kerberos 1.0.2
  <li>OpenSSH 2.3.0
 </ul>
</ul>

<p>
If you'd like to see a list of what has changed between OpenBSD 2.7 and
2.8, look at
</p>
<blockquote>
        <a href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/plus28.html">http://www.OpenBSD.org/plus28.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p>
Even though the list is a summary of the most important changes made to
OpenBSD, it still is a very very long list -- more than 700 major changes.
</p>

<p>
This is our ninth OpenBSD release, and the eighth release which is
available on CDROM.  Our releases have been spaced six months apart,
and we plan to continue this timing.
</p>

<hr>
<h2><font color="#0000e0">SECURITY AND ERRATA</font></h2>

<p>
We provide patches for known security threats and other important issues
discovered after each CD release.  As usual, between the creation of the
OpenBSD 2.8 FTP/CDROM binaries and the actual 2.8 release date, our team
found and fixed some new reliability problems (note: most are minor, and
in subsystems that are not enabled by default).  Our continued research
into security means we will find new security problems -- and we always
provide patches as soon as possible.  Therefore, we advise regular
visits to 
</p>
<blockquote>
     <a href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/security.html">http://www.OpenBSD.org/security.html</a>
</blockquote>

and

</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2><font color="#0000e0">CDROM SALES</font></h2>

<p>
OpenBSD 2.8 is also available on CDROM.  A 2-CD set which costs $30USD
is available via mail order and from a number of contacts around the
world.  The set includes a colourful booklet which carefully explains
the installation of OpenBSD.  A new set of cute little stickers are also
included (sorry, but our FTP mirror sites do not support STP, the
Sticker Transfer Protocol).  Profits from these sales are the primary
income source for the OpenBSD project -- in essence selling these
CDROM units ensures that OpenBSD will continue to make another release
six months from now.
</p>

<p>
For more information on ordering CDROMs, see
</p>
<blockquote>
        <a href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/orders.html">http://www.OpenBSD.org/orders.html</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
The above web page lists a number of places where OpenBSD CDROMs can
be purchased from.  For our default mail order, go directly to
</p>
<blockquote>
        <a href="https://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order">https://https.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/order</a>

<p>
All of our developers strongly urge you to buy a CDROM and support our
future efforts.  As well, donations to the project are highly
appreciated, as described in more detail at

<hr>
<h2><font color="#0000e0">T-SHIRT SALES</font></h2>

<p>
The project continues to expand its funding base by selling t-shirts and
polo shirts.  And our users like them too.  We have a variety of shirts
available, with the new and old designs, from our web ordering system at
</p>

<p>
With this release, we introduce 2 new shirts.
</p>

<hr>
<h2><font color="#0000e0">FTP INSTALLS</font></h2>
<p>
If you choose not to buy an OpenBSD CDROM, OpenBSD can be easily
installed via FTP.  Typically you need a single small piece of boot
media (e.g., a boot floppy) and then the rest of the files can be
installed from a number of locations, including directly off the
Internet.  Follow this simple set of instructions to ensure that you
find all of the documentation you will need while performing an install
via FTP.  With the CDROMs, the necessary documentation is easier to find.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Read either of the following two files for a list of ftp
   mirrors which provide OpenBSD, then choose one near you:
<blockquote>
        <a href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/ftp.html">http://www.OpenBSD.org/ftp.html</a>
        <a href="ftp://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/ftplist">ftp://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/ftplist</a>
</blockquote>
<li>Connect to that ftp mirror site and go into the directory
   pub/OpenBSD/2.8/ which contains these files and directories.  This is
   a list of what you will see:
<pre>
        Changelogs/      amiga/           packages/        srcsys.tar.gz
        HARDWARE         ftplist          pmax/            sun3/
        PACKAGES         hp300/           ports.tar.gz     tools/
        PORTS            i386/            powerpc/         vax/
        README           log28            root.mail
        SIZES            mac68k/          sparc/
        X11.tar.gz       mvme68k/         src.tar.gz
</pre>
   It is quite likely that you will want at LEAST the following files which
   apply to all the architectures OpenBSD supports.
<pre>
        README          - generic README
        HARDWARE        - list of hardware we support
        SIZES           - recommended partition sizes
        PORTS           - description of our "ports" tree
        PACKAGES        - description of pre-compiled packages
        root.mail       - a copy of root's mail at initial login. (This is
                          really worthwhile reading).
</pre>
<li>Read the file README.  It is short, and a quick read will make sure you
   understand what else you need to fetch.

<li>Next, go into the directory that applies to your architecture, for
   example, i386.  This is a list of what you will see:
<pre>
        CKSUM            INSTALL.os2br    comp28.tgz       man28.tgz
        INSTALL.ata      INSTALL.pt       etc28.tgz        misc28.tgz
        INSTALL.chs      MD5              floppy28.fs      xbase28.tgz
        INSTALL.dbr      base28.tgz       floppyB28.fs     xfont28.tgz
        INSTALL.i386     bsd*             floppyC28.fs     xlink28.tgz
        INSTALL.linux    bsd.rd*          game28.tgz       xserv28.tgz
        INSTALL.mbr      cdrom28.fs       index.txt        xshare28.tgz
</pre>
   If you are new to OpenBSD, fetch _at least_ the file INSTALL.i386 and
   one of the floppy*.fs files; the README file lists both as required for
   installation.

<li>If you are an expert, follow the instructions in the file called README;
   otherwise, use the more complete instructions in the file called
   INSTALL.i386.  INSTALL.i386 may tell you that you need to fetch other
   files.

<li>Just in case, take a peek at
<blockquote>
        <a href="http://www.OpenBSD.org/errata28.html">http://www.OpenBSD.org/errata28.html</a>
</blockquote>
   This is the page where we talk about the mistakes we made while
   creating the 2.8 release, or the significant bugs we fixed
   post-release which we think our users should have fixes for.  Patches
   and workarounds are clearly described there.
</ol>
<p>
Note: If you end up needing to write a raw floppy using MSDOS, look in
      pub/OpenBSD/2.8/tools for the "rawrite.*" files.
</p>
<hr>
<h2><font color="#0000e0">XFree86 FOR MOST ARCHITECTURES</font></h2>
<p>
XFree86 has been integrated more closely into the system.  This
release contains XFree86 3.3.6.  Most of our architectures ship with
XFree86, even the sparc and powerpc.  During installation, you can install
XFree86 quite easily.  Be sure to try out xdm(1)
<!--
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=xdm&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=OpenBSD+Current&arch=i386&format=html">xdm(1)</a>
-->
and see how we have customized it for OpenBSD.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><font color="#0000e0">PORTS TREE</font></h2>

<p>
The OpenBSD ports tree contains automated instructions for building
third party software.  The software has been verified to build and run
on the various OpenBSD architectures.  The 2.8 ports collection,
including many of the distribution files, is included on the 2-CD set.
Please see PORTS file for more information.
</p>
<p>
Note: some of the most popular ports, e.g., the Apache web server and
several X applications, are now a standard part of OpenBSD.  Also,
other popular ports have been pre-compiled for those who do not desire
to build their own binaries (see PACKAGES, below).
</p>

<hr>
<h2><font color="#0000e0">BINARY PACKAGES WE PROVIDE</font></h2>

<p>
A number of binary packages are provided.  Please see the
<a href="ftp://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/PACKAGES">PACKAGES file</a> for more details.
</p>

<hr>
<h2><font color="#0000e0">SYSTEM SOURCE CODE</font></h2>

<p>
The CDROMs contain source code for all the subsystems explained above,
and the README (ftp://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/README) file
explains how to deal with these source files.  For those who are doing
an FTP install, the source code for all four subsystems can be
found in the pub/OpenBSD/2.8/ directory:
</p>
<pre>
        X11.tar.gz     ports.tar.gz   src.tar.gz     srcsys.tar.gz
</pre>

<hr>
<h2><font color="#0000e0">THANKS</font></h2>

<p>
OpenBSD 2.8 introduces artwork and CD artistic layout by Ty Semaka
(who as it happens, performs in a band called the 
<a href="http://www.thedevils.com/">Plaid Tongued Devils</a>).

<p>
We would like to thank all of the people who sent in bug reports, bug
fixes, donation cheques, and hardware that we use.  We would also like
to thank those who bought our previous CDROMs.  Those who did not
support us financially have still helped us with our goal of improving
the quality of the software.
