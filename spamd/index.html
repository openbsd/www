<hr>

<p>
OpenBSD's <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/spamd">spamd(8)</a> is a spam deferral
daemon which rejects false mail in a very efficient way.

<p>
A variety of databases exist which can be specified in the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/spamd.conf">/etc/mail/spamd.conf</a>
file, and loaded using
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/spamd-setup">spamd-setup(8)</a>.

<p>
However, most of the publicly available lists providing access to
the whole database in a downloadable file have now shut down.
If you were using the nixspam list previously mirrored here,
you should remove it.
