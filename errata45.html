<strong>001: RELIABILITY FIX: April 8, 2009</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
The OpenSSL ASN.1 handling code could be forced to perform invalid memory
accesses through the use of certain invalid strings
(<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0590">CVE-2009-0590</a>)
or under certain error conditions triggerable by invalid ASN.1 structures
(<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0789">CVE-2009-0789</a>).
These vulnerabilities could be exploited to achieve a
denial-of-service. A more detailed description of these problems is available
in the
<a href="http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20090325.txt">OpenSSL security advisory</a>, but note that the other issue described there "Incorrect Error
Checking During CMS verification" relates to code not enabled in OpenBSD.

<strong>002: RELIABILITY FIX: April 11, 2009</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
When pf attempts to perform translation on a specially crafted IP datagram,
a null pointer dereference will occur, resulting in a kernel panic.
In certain configurations this may be triggered by a remote attacker.
<br>
Restricting translation rules to protocols that are specific to the IP version
in use, is an effective workaround until the patch can be installed. As an
example, for IPv4 nat/binat/rdr rules you can use:
<pre>
    nat/rdr ... inet proto { tcp udp icmp } ...
</pre>
Or for IPv6 nat/binat/rdr rules you can use:
<pre>
    nat/rdr ... inet6 proto { tcp udp icmp6 } ...
</pre>

<strong>003: RELIABILITY FIX: April 24, 2009</strong>
&nbsp; <i>i386 only</i><br>
When DMA'able memory is mapped by device drivers, the
mapping flags and protection are partially uninitialized.
Depending on the calling context, this may cause devices to misbehave, like
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.5/audio.4">audio(4)</a>
to stutter, but other anomalies might be observed for other
device types.

<strong>004: RELIABILITY FIX: April 24, 2009</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
In server mode when in full-duplex mode (the default)
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.5/aucat.1">aucat(1)</a>
will send each synchronization message twice, causing client applications
to think that buffer underruns are occuring.  Depending on the
application, this may cause the sound to stutter.

<li id="p005_audio">
<strong>005: RELIABILITY FIX: April 24, 2009</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
On very high system load, an audio interrupt may occur while the
audio process is filling audio ring buffers. This triggers bogus
(and useless) correction code in the
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.5/audio.4">audio(4)</a>
driver causing the audio application to go out of sync, and in turn causing
continuous stuttering until the application is restarted.

<strong>006: RELIABILITY FIX: June 24, 2009</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
An off-by-one error in the inflate function in Zlib.xs in the
Compress::Raw::Zlib perl module before 2.017 (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1391">CVE-2009-1391</a>),
as used in AMaViS, SpamAssassin, and possibly other products,
allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
(hang or crash) via a crafted zlib compressed stream that
triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

<strong>010: SECURITY FIX: November 26, 2009</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
The SSL/TLS protocol is subject to man-in-the-middle attacks related to
renegotiation (see CVE-2009-3555, draft-ietf-tls-renegotiation-00).
OpenSSL permitted this protocol feature by default and had no way to
disable it.

<strong>011: RELIABILITY FIX: January 29, 2010</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
By using ptrace(2) on an ancestor process, a loop in the process tree
could be created, violating assumptions in other parts of the kernel
and resulting in infinite loops.

<li id="p014_kerberos">
<strong>014: RELIABILITY FIX: March 31, 2010</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
When decrypting packets, the internal decryption functions were not
paranoid enough in checking for underruns, which could potentially
lead to crashes.

<li id="p015_mpi">
<strong>015: RELIABILITY FIX: April 4, 2010</strong>
&nbsp; <i>All architectures</i><br>
When updating sensors showing the state of RAID volumes
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.5/mpi.4">mpi(4)</a>
allocates temporary memory and then returns it to the kernel as
device memory.
This causes kernel memory usage to be misrepresented, eventually
leading to a denial of service when a resource limit is apparently
reached.
