<dt id="book14"><i>Httpd and Relayd Mastery</i>
<dd>by Michael W. Lucas
<dd>ISBN-10: 1-54675-206-4
<dd>ISBN-13: 978-1-54675-206-6
<dd>May 2017, 232 pp.
<p>
"I think we're gonna need a bigger web server."
<p>
OpenBSD has a solid reputation for security and stability.
It's well known for the OpenSMTPd mail server, the LibreSSL cryptography
library, and the PF packet filter. But nobody ever talks about the load
balancer, or the web server.
<p>
Until now.
<p>
The httpd web server provides a fast, stable, secure environment for your
web applications. The relayd load balancer lets you distribute Internet
application load across multiple hosts. Between the two, you can slash
hundreds of thousands of dollars off the cost of building, deploying,
and managing applications.
<p>

<dt id="book13"><i>The Book of PF, 3rd Edition<br>
A No-Nonsense Guide to the OpenBSD Firewall</i>
<dd>by Peter N. M. Hansteen
<dd>ISBN-10: 1-59327-589-7
<dd>ISBN-13: 978-1-59327-589-1
<dd>October 2014, 248 pp.
<p>
The first sentence of this book is "<i>This is a book about building the
network you need.</i>" Taking it from there, Peter walks you through the whys
and the hows of building the high performance, low maintenance network you need,
using OpenBSD tools.
The book covers all bases, from the basic one machine configuration and basic
local area networks, all the way up to configurations with traffic shaping and
load balancing with "self-healing" networks and countermeasures against common
problems such as DoS attempts and spamming.  A basic understanding of TCP/IP
and some Unix knowledge is assumed.

<i>The Design and Implementation of the 4.4BSD Operating System</i>
<dd>by Marshal Kirk McKusick, Keith Bostic, Michael J. Karels, John S. Quarterman
<dd>ISBN-10: 0132317923
<dd>ISBN-13: 978-0132317924
<dd>
At 549 pages plus an index, this book must be considered comprehensive.
McKusick, Bostic and Karels are well known as prime movers at
Berkeley CSRG (Computer Systems Research Group) during the 4.3/4.4BSD
period. This book covers the 4.4 and 4.4-Lite releases, and discusses
everything you wanted to know about how the system operates.  Not
100% applicable, but probably the closest there is to an overall
system internals manual for OpenBSD.
<p>

<dt>
<i>Source Code Secrets: The Basic 386BSD Operating System Reference
(Volume 1 of Operating System Source Code Secrets)</i>
<dd>by L. W. Jolitz, William Jolitz; 1997
<dd>
The Jolitzes built the first port of BSD to the PC-386 architecture,
and deserve a lot of credit for making BSD portable to this low-cost
architecture. The earliest versions, called "386bsd", were described
in articles in <em>Dr. Dobbs Journal</em>. This book goes beyond the articles,
and provides a comprehensive annotated collection of source code.
Not all of it applies to modern versions of OpenBSD, of course, but
you can still learn a lot from it.
<p>

<dt>
<i>Berkeley Unix: A Simple and Comprehensive Guide</i>
<dd>by James Wilson

<i>4.4BSD User's Reference Manual (URM)</i>
<dd>published by O'Reilly, 1994
<dd>
This is just a reprint of the man pages for users.
Your OpenBSD distribution includes the online man pages,
which are specific to OpenBSD, and more up to date. So
you don't need this one: use the <em>man</em> command instead.
<p>

<dt>
<dt>
<i>4.4BSD System Manager's Manual (SMM)</i>
<dd>published by O'Reilly, 1994
<dd>
This book details what you need to know to run a BSD system.
Quite a bit of this material is relevant to OpenBSD.
Unfortunately it is currently out of print.
Worse, due to licensing restrictions from AT&amp;T,
the electronic editions of these were not included in the
4.4BSD distributions.
They are not included with OpenBSD.

<h3>Unix user guides</h3>
<dl>
<dt><i>Unix Made Easy</i>
<dd>by John Muster
<dd>A general Unix book that covers all areas of the system.
<p>

<dt><i>UNIX Power Tools</i>
<dd>by Jerry D. Peek, Tim O'Reilly, and Mike Loukides
<dd>
This book is now in its third edition. It discusses
hundreds of neat tricks, little-known techniques, and add-on utilities.
Be aware that many of the utilities are either included with OpenBSD
or, more commonly, are already available as ports or packages.
So most of section 52.03, complaining about how hard it is to port
software to different UNIXes, can be disregarded if you learn about the
<a href="faq/ports/index.html">Ports System</a>
that is part of OpenBSD.
<p>

<dt><i><a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/multiboot/">The Multi-Boot Configuration Handbook</a></i>
<dd>by Rod Smith
<dd>
<dd>
Book explaining techniques for Multi-booting.

<h3>Unix administration</h3>
<dl>
<dt><i>UNIX System Administration Handbook</i>
<dd>by Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder, Scott Seebass, Trent R. Hein
<dd>
This is an excellent book on Unix system administration.
<p>

<dt id="book11"><i>Sudo Mastery</i>
<dd>by Michael W. Lucas
<dd>ISBN-13: 978-1493626205
<dd>ISBN-10: 1493626205
<dd>October 2013, 144pp.
<dd>Access Control for Real People
<p>
Unix-like operating systems use a rudimentary access control system:
the root account can do anything, while other users are peasants with
only minimal access. This worked fine in UNIX's youth, but today,
system administration responsibilities are spread among many people
and applications.  Different people may need different slices of
root's power. However pros and cons are considered as well.
This book also thoroughly covers sudo's extended features.

<a href="https://www.michaelwlucas.com/nonfiction/sudo-mastery">here</a>.
<p>

<dt><i>Essential System Administration</i>
<dd>by &AElig;leen Frisch
<dd>

<h3>Unix programming</h3>
<dl>
<dt><i>Unix Systems for Modern Architectures</i>
<dd>by Curt Schimmel
<dd>
This book leads its reader through all the low-level kernel models for
multi-processing architectures.
<p>

<dt><i>Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition with Source Code</i>
<dd>by John Lions
<dd>
Although the UNIX described in this book is to BSD as a Model T Ford
is to a 70's Mustang or Thunderbird, UNIX inventor Ken Thompson
claims that "After 20 years, this is still the best exposition
of the workings of a 'real' operating system." Originally circulated
in illicit photocopies, this is the book that most first- and second-generation
UNIX hackers cut their code-teeth on. Recommended as a good introduction
to how a timesharing OS works, if you've not been inside one before.
Substantially shorter than the McKusick book above.
<p>

<dt><i>The Practice of Programming</i>
<dd>by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike
<dd>
Brian Kernighan had a hand in two other books which we recommend even though they're not UNIX specific, but are useful to programmers on UNIX and elsewhere.
This book covers practical programming considerations for C, C++ and Java.
Highly recommended.
<p>

<dt><i>The Elements of Programming Style</i>
<dd>by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger
<dd>
This book is similar to <i>The Practice of Programming</i>, but older.  The
examples are given in Fortran and PL/I.
<p>

<dt><i>Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment (3rd Edition)</i>
<dd>by W. Richard Stevens, Stephen A. Rago
<dd>
This is a very detailed and easy to read book.  It has several examples
that you can learn from.  There is plenty of information about library and
system calls, and associated information so that you can use them.
This book along with the OpenBSD manual pages
make an excellent combination.
<p>

<dt><i>The C Programming Language</i>
<dd>by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie
<dd>
This is a clear and concise guide to the C programming language,
perhaps the only one you will ever need.  It focuses strictly on the C language,
not how to use your compiler or anything else.
<p>

<dt><i>C: A Reference Manual</i>
<dd>by Samuel P. Harbison and Guy L. Steele
<dd>
If you only had two books on C, then along with <i>The C Programming Language</i>, this would be your second one!
This book is not a tutorial (hence the title), it deals with syntax, data types,
ISO C library functions, and C/C++ compatibility.
<p>

<dt><i>The Art of Software Security Assessment</i>
<dd>by Mark Dowd, John McDonald and Justin Schuh
<dd>Covers code auditing, design and operational review, types of
vulnerabilities, privilege models, signals,
interprocess communication, synchronization, networking and more.
Lots of examples and real world code snippets.

<dt id="book6"><i>Das SSH-Buch</i>
(German)
<dd>by Timo Dotzauer and Tobias L&uuml;tticke
<dd>ISBN 3-938626-03-8
<dd>Millin Verlag, December 2006, 600p.
<dd>This book covers the theory behind OpenSSH (protocol, channels, standards
documents) as well as using OpenSSH as an end user.
Although using Linux as a reference OS, many of the examples also have
a description how to get things done under BSD.
In a separate cookbook chapter, several scenarios from daily work are solved
using OpenSSH.
Furthermore, this book is the first German book to cover VPN via OpenSSH.

<dd>ISBN-13: 978-1484924471
<dd>ISBN-10: 1484924479
<dd>May 2013, 130 pp.
<dd>Securing the Domain Name System with BIND
<p>
DNS is one of the oldest protocols on the Internet, and was designed
for a network without hostile users. Anyone who wants to break into a
network starts by investigating the target's Domain Name Service.
<p>
In addition to providing a manual for BIND, this book thoroughly targets
the extensions which are available in the port net/isc-bind. DNS Security
Extensions, or DNSSEC, harden DNS.  But learning DNSSEC requires
wading through years of obsolete tutorials, dead ends, and
inscrutable standards.  Strengths and weaknesses of DNSSEC are
discussed.
