<dt><a name="book8"><i>The Book of PF, 2nd Edition<br>
A No-Nonsense Guide to the OpenBSD Firewall</i></a>
<dd>by Peter N. M. Hansteen
<dd>ISBN-13: 978-1-59327-274-6 
<dd>November 2010.
<dd>
The first sentence of this book is, "<i>This is a book about building the 
network you need</i>". Taking it from there, Peter walks you through the whys 
and the hows of building the high performance, low maintenance network you need,
using OpenBSD tools.<br>
The book covers all bases from the basic one machine configuration and basic 
local area networks, all the way up to configurations with traffic shaping and 
load balancing with "self healing" networks and countermeasures against common 
problems such as DoS attempts and spamming.  A basic understanding of TCP/IP 
and some Unix knowledge is assumed.<br>

<dd>Access Control for Real People
<dd>   

Unix-like operating systems use a rudimentary access control system:
the root account can do anything, while other users are peasants with
only minimal access. This worked fine in UNIX's youth, but today,
system administration responsibilities are spread among many people
and applications.  Different people may need different slices of
root's power. However pros and cons are considered as well.<p>

This book also thoroughly covers extended features used in other
operating systems, but not supported in OpenBSD's more minimalist
policy.

<dd>Securing the Domain Name System with Bind.
<dd>

DNS is one of the oldest protocols on the Internet, and was designed
for a network without hostile users. Anyone who wants to break into a
network starts by investigating the target's Domain Name Service. <p>

In addition to providing a manual for "bind", which is in OpenBSD's
default configuration, this book thoroughly targets the extensions
which are available in the port net/isc-bind.  DNS Security
Extensions, or DNSSEC, hardens DNS.  But learning DNSSEC requires
wading through years of obsolete tutorials, dead ends, and
inscrutable standards.  Strengths and weaknesses of DNSSEC are
discussed, some of which may explain why OpenBSD does not support the
extended features by default.

<h3>BSD-specific books</h3>

<dt>
<i>The Design and Implementation of the 4.4 BSD Operating System</i>
<dd>by Marshal Kirk McKusick, Keith Bostic, Michael J. Karels, John S. Quarterman
<dd>
At 549 pages plus an index, <a href="http://www.awprofessional.com/title/0201549794">this book</a> must be considered comprehensive.
McKusick, Bostic and Karels are well known as prime movers at
Berkeley CSRG (Computer Systems Research Group) during the 4.3/4.4BSD
period. This book covers the 4.4 and 4.4-Lite releases, and discusses
everything you wanted to know about how the system operates.  Not
100% applicable, but probably the closest there is to an overall
system internals manual for OpenBSD.
<p>
<dt>
<i>Source Code Secrets: The Basic 386BSD Operating System Reference
(Volume 1 of Operating System Source Code Secrets)</i>
<dd>by L. W. Jolitz, William Jolitz; 1997
<dd>
The Jolitzes built the first port of BSD to the PC-386 architecture,
and deserve a lot of credit for making BSD portable to this low-cost
architecture. The earliest versions, called "386bsd", were described
in articles in <em>Dr. Dobbs Journal</em>. This book goes beyond the articles,
and provides a comprehensive annotated collection of source code.
Not all of it applies to modern versions of OpenBSD, of course, but
you can still learn a lot from it.
<p>
<dt>
<i>Berkeley Unix: A Simple and Comprehensive Guide</i>
<dd>by James Wilson
<dd>
Begins with the basic commands and finishes with advanced programming
techniques. Offers strong coverage of systems calls.
<p>
<dt>
<i>An Introduction to Berkeley Unix and ANSI C</i>
<dd>by Jack Hodges
<dd>
An introduction to the operating system and the programming language.  Intended
for self-study, requires no previous knowledge of Unix.  Covers the fundamentals
of programming; the correct use of syntax; programming style, debugging, logic,
and system programming with C.
<p>
<dt>
<dt>
<i>4.4 BSD User's Reference Manual (URM)</i>
<dd>published by O'Reilly, 1994
<dd>
This is just a reprint of the man pages for users. 
Your OpenBSD distribution includes the online man pages,
which are specific to OpenBSD, and more up-to-date. So
you don't need this one: use the <em>man</em> command instead.
<p>
<dt>
<dt>
<i>4.4 BSD System Manager's Manual (SMM)</i>
<dd>published by O'Reilly, 1994
<dd>
This book details what you need to know to run a BSD system.
Quite a bit of this material is relevant to OpenBSD.
Unfortunately it is currently out of print.
Worse, due to licensing restrictions from AT&amp;T,
the electronic editions of these were not included in the
4.4BSD distributions.
They are not included with OpenBSD.
<p>
<dt>
<dt>
<i>BSD mit Methode</i>
<dd>published by C&amp;L Computer- und Literaturverlag GmbH, 1998
<dd>
A book in German on all
three freenix BSDs covering the essentials of installation, X configuration
and system administration, as well as PERL programming and tips on
LaTeX/Lyx. The book also covers the KDE desktop environment.

<h3>Unix user guides</h3>
<dl>
<dt><i>Unix Made Easy</i>
<dd>by John Muster
<dd>A general Unix book that covers all areas of the system. 
<p>
<dt><i>UNIX Power Tools</i>
<dd>by Jerry D. Peek, Tim O'Reilly, and Mike Loukides
<dd>
This book is now in its third edition. It discusses
hundreds of neat tricks, little-known techniques, and add-on utilities.
Be aware that many of the utilities are either included with OpenBSD
or, more commonly, are already available as ports or packages.
So most of section 52.03, complaining about how hard it is to port
software to different UNIXes, can be disregarded if you learn about the
<a href="faq/ports/index.html">Ports Mechanism</a>
that is part of OpenBSD.
<p>
<dt><i><a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/multiboot/">The Multi-Boot Configuration Handbook</a></i>
<dd>by Rod Smith
<dd>
<dd>
Book explaining techniques for Multi-booting.

<dt><i>Unix Systems for Modern Architectures</i>
<dd>by Curt Schimmel
<dd>
This book leads its reader through all the low-level kernel models for 
multi-processing architectures.
<p>
<dt><i>Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition with Source Code</i>
<dd>by John Lions
<dd>
Although the UNIX described in this book is to BSD as a Model T Ford
is to a 70's Mustang or Thunderbird, UNIX inventor Ken Thompson
claims that "After 20 years, this is still the best exposition
of the workings of a 'real' operating system." Originally circulated
in illicit photocopies, this is the book that most first- and second-generation
UNIX hackers cut their code-teeth on. Recommended as a good introduction
to how a timesharing OS works, if you've not been inside one before.
Substantially shorter than the McKusick book above.
<p>
<dt><i>The Practice of Programming</i>
<dd>by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike
<dd>
Brian Kernighan had a hand in two other books which we recommend even though they're not UNIX specific, but are useful to programmers on UNIX and elsewhere.
This book covers practical programming considerations for C, C++ and Java. 
Highly recommended.
<p>
<dt><i>The Elements of Programming Style</i>
<dd>by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger
<dd>
This book is similar to <i>The Practice of Programming</i>, but older.  The
examples are given in Fortran and PL/I.  
<p>
<dt><i>Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment (2nd Edition)</i>
<dd>by W. Richard Stevens, Stephen A. Rago
<dd>
This is a very detailed and easy to read book.  It has several examples
that you can learn from.  There is plenty of information about library and
system calls, and associated information so that you can use them.
This book along with the OpenBSD manual pages
make an excellent combination.
<p>
<dt><i>The C Programming Language</i>
<dd>by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie
<dd>
This is a clear and concise guide to the C programming language,
perhaps the only one you will ever need.  It focuses strictly on the C language,
not how to use your compiler or anything else.
<p>
<dt><i>C: A Reference Manual</i> 
<dd>by Samuel P. Harbison and Guy L. Steele 
<dd>
If you only had two books on C, then along with <i>The C Programming Language</i>, this would be your second one!
This book is not a tutorial (hence the title), it deals with syntax, data types,
ISO C library functions, and C/C++ compatibility.
<p>
<dt><i>The Art of Software Security Assessment</i>
<dd>by Mark Dowd, John McDonald and Justin Schuh
<dd>Covers code auditing, design and operational review, types of
vulnerabilities, privilege models, signals,
interprocess communication, synchronization, networking and more.
Lots of examples and real world code snippets.

<dd>Millin Verlag, December 2006, 600p.
<dd>This book covers the theory behind OpenSSH (protocol, channels, standards
documents) as well as using OpenSSH as an end user.
Although using Linux as a reference OS, many of the examples also have
a description how to get things done under BSD.
In a separate cookbook chapter, several scenarios from daily work are solved
using OpenSSH.
Furthermore, this book is the first German book to cover VPN via OpenSSH.
<dd>
<p>
<dt><i>SSH, The Secure Shell.</i>
<dd>by Daniel J. Barrett and Richard Silverman
<dd>The Definitive Guide.  OpenSSH is covered in detail.
<p>
<dt><i>TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1</i>
<dd>by W. Richard Stevens
<dd>
"Network administration" is really an inappropriate heading for this book.  It
is an encyclopedia of the TCP/IP protocol suite.  This book provides information,
and diagrams useful to understand the suite to its lowest level.
Home enthusiasts, developers, and network administrators alike will enjoy this
book.
<p>
<dt><i>Kerberos: A Network Authentication System</i>
