<h2><font color="#e00000">Products for OpenBSD</font></h2>
<hr>

<p>
OpenBSD encourages companies and independent developers to create
products for use with OpenBSD, or based on OpenBSD itself.

<p>
Commercial support for OpenBSD is available from vendors listed on 
<a href=support.html>our support page</a>.
<p>

<h2><font color="#e00000"><strong>Products based on
    OpenBSD</strong></font></h2>

<p>
The following products are based on OpenBSD:
<ul>

<li><font color="#e00000"><strong>RTMX</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.rtmx.com">RTMX</a> sells a version of OpenBSD which
has a full complement of POSIX real-time features added to it. They have
graciously donated the source code for these extensions, and these
changes will be integrated into OpenBSD soon.
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000"><strong>genua</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.genua.eu/">genua mbh</a>,
a company based in Munich, Germany, offers sophisticated IT security
solutions based on OpenBSD:
The two-tier genugate system is the only firewall certified by the
German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) as "Highly Resistant".
<br>
In 2012, the genugate has been re-certified using the Common Criteria
international standard at the level EAL4+.
<br>
The security platform genubox was
developed for remote control of machines via the Internet. Among others,
an important function of this genua product is to set up SSH-encrypted
tunnels for data transmission via the Internet and to provide an
integrated application platform.
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000"><strong>.vantronix</strong></font><br> <a
href="http://www.vantronix.com/">.vantronix GmbH</a> offers security
appliances based on OpenBSD.  The underlying operating system is
closely based on the official OpenBSD -stable releases extended with a
powerful CLI, administration and monitoring interfaces, binary
updates, preinspection services and integration into HP ProCurve
networks.  The company is located in Hannover, Germany, and provides
international support and services supported by a network of partners.
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000"><strong>Fox-IT</strong></font><br> <a

<h2><font color="#e00000"><strong>Hardware/Software products for
    OpenBSD</strong></font></h2>

<p>
The following products are known to work on OpenBSD:
<ul>

<li><font color="#e00000"><strong>PowerCrypt by GTGI</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.gtgi.com">Global Technologies Group, Inc.</a> 
produces <a href="http://www.powercrypt.com">PowerCrypt</a>, an
intelligent, bus-mastering PCI board that incorporates the Hifn 7751
encryption processor. Kernel-level support was developed by <a
href="crypto.html#hardware">OpenBSD</a>, with device drivers and IPsec
code written by members of the OpenBSD community.
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000"><strong>Open Sound System by 4Front</strong></font> (i386 only)<br>
<a href="http://www.opensound.com">4Front Technologies</a> provides a
substantially spiffed-up commercial version of the OpenBSD/i386 audio
device drivers. These replacement drivers are compatible with the audio
drivers OpenBSD/i386 ships with, but they support many additional cards
and take full advantage of these cards' features. <a
href="http://www.opensound.com/openbsd.html">This package is available
for OpenBSD/i386 3.x</a>
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000"><strong>Core Systems</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.core.dk">Core Systems</a> sells <a
href="http://www.core.dk/products/insite/index_en.html">InSite</a>, an
easy to use, server-side web statistics utility, for OpenBSD/i386.
InSite is similar to products such as WebTrends, but can also be
configured through a web interface to generate reports on the fly, using
very little CPU time. (Upon request, Core may be able to provide InSite
for platforms other then i386.)
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000"><strong>Software2Go Motif</strong></font> (i386 and SPARC only)<br>
