href="http://www.stallion.com/html/corporate/epipe-openbsd-pr.html">OpenBSD
as an embedded operating system</a> in its ePipe dial-up network gateway
for small and medium businesses. The gateway box is intended to beat the
high cost of <a 
href="http://www.stallion.com/html/products/epipe-white-papers.html">the
last mile</a> for small business VPNs and
<a href="http://www.stallion.com/html/corporate/asp-release.html">application

<li><font color=#e00000><strong>NFR</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.nfr.net/">NFR</a> uses OpenBSD as their primary development
platform for their Network Flight Recorder intrusion detection software.

embedded product called the <a href=http://www.nfr.net/products/ida-facts.html>
NFR Intrusion Detection Appliance</a>, which happens to run OpenBSD internally.
On their web page, NFR doesn't tell their customers that the operating
system inside the IDA is OpenBSD.

<a href="http://www.securitywizards.com">Network Security Wizards</a> 
produces the Dragon IDS for the OpenBSD platform.
Dragon is a packet based intrusion detection system which can operate with
1200 signatures. The signatures identify all phases of network misuse
including probes, attacks and actual compromises. Dragon operates on
fully saturated 100 Mb/s networks and many Dragon customers operate in the
200 Mb/s range on Gigabit Ethernet segments.  NSW also sells 2U boxes
running OpenBSD + Dragon, for people who wish to just plug & play.
