<h2><font color="#e00000">Users</font></h2>
<hr>
The term "users" has several connotations. <EM>End users</EM> often
want to meet other users of the system, to share ideas, problems and solutions,
and discuss the system over a meal or a beer. One of the best ways to do this
is with one of our 
<a href="groups.html">User Groups worldwide</a>.
<p>
Another connotation of the term is "who is using the system, and for what?",
and that is the subject of the rest of this page.  These <a 
href="#com">companies</a> and organizations trust OpenBSD's rigorous code audit 
and security-first development model. They use the system to build firewalls, 
intrusion detection systems, or general purpose servers. 
<a href="#edu">University researchers</a> and IT department developers often 
have similar security and stability requirements and choose OpenBSD.
Many <a href="#isp">Internet Service Providers</a> find OpenBSD's
security features hard to resist.

Azienda Ospedaliera "Carlo Poma" is the largest health institution in
the province of Mantova (Lombardia) with six hospitals and other small
ambulatories.  OpenBSD was chosen for its reliability and now serves as
the bridging firewall between the WAN and the main Hospital of Mantova.
We use pf and altq for firewalling and QoS applications, and use fwanalog
to generate WAN traffic statistics.

ENEP Iztacala is one of <A HREF="http://www.unam.mx">UNAM</A>'s peripheral
schools. UNAM is Mexico's largest University, with over 250,000 students,
and at ENEP Iztacala we have a bit over 10,000 students. This is mostly
a health-oriented campus, so the computer area is not a big one.
<br>
We run as servers currently two OpenBSD, one Solaris and two Linux boxes.
With OpenBSD we handle the main web site (happily running on a 7-year old
Sparcstation 5), part of our mail accounts and our firewall.
<br>
There are two additional OpenBSD computers, in our development area. One of
them acts as a network monitor (using Snort) and will shortly be moved to
sit next to the firewall, and the other one serves as an OpenBSD CVS
mirror (<strong>CVSROOT=anoncvs@anoncvs.mx.openbsd.org:/cvs</strong>).
<br>
We do not do run very creative stuff, we just use OpenBSD for what it does
best: run smoothly, even on older hardware, freeing us from most concerns
and doubts we have about our other operating systems.
<br>
We also host a Spanish OpenBSD mailing list (openbsd@tlali.iztacala.unam.mx).

Hostmaster Henning Brauer writes:<br>
<i>"OpenBSD needed some tuning on these machines, especially bigger maxprocs
and maxfiles, but it handles extraordinary loads on ordinary hardware. We are
using AMD Athlons (mostly the new Thunderbirds) and AMD K6-III's. We also have
some internal machines running OpenBSD as testbeds and printservers and all
sorts of other purposes. We plan to move some more machines to OpenBSD,
especially our firewalls. Unfortunately we are still running some closed
source software, but we'd like to try the Linux emulation. OpenBSD's
behaviour under high load, especially under DoS attacks, just doesn't
compare to the Linux we used before - Linux went extremely slow, while
OpenBSD doesn't even care (same hardware!)"</i>.
