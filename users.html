<h2><font color="#e00000">Users</font></h2>
<hr>
The term "users" has several connotations. <em>End users</em> often
want to meet other users of the system, to share ideas, problems and solutions,
and discuss the system over a meal or a beer. One of the best ways to do this
is with one of our 
<a href="groups.html">User Groups worldwide</a>.
<p>
Another connotation of the term is "who is using the system, and for what?",
and that is the subject of the rest of this page.  These <a 
href="#com">companies</a> and organizations trust OpenBSD's rigorous code audit 
and security-first development model. They use the system to build firewalls, 
intrusion detection systems, or general purpose servers. 
<a href="#edu">University researchers</a> and IT department developers often 
have similar security and stability requirements and choose OpenBSD.
Many <a href="#isp">Internet Service Providers</a> find OpenBSD's
security features hard to resist.
Even <a href="#gov">governments</a> from different countries pick OpenBSD
for securing their vital informational infrastructure.
