For a comprehensive list, see the <a href=plus30.html>changelog</a> leading
to 3.0.
<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.OpenSSH.com">OpenSSH</a> (supporting both the
SSH1 and SSH2 protocols) is now at version 3.0. Secure file transfers are
encouraged using the greatly enhanced SFTP subsystem which now comes both with
an SFTP server and client.
<p>

<h3><font color=#0000e0>How to install</font></h3>
<p>
Following this are the instructions which you would have on a piece of
paper if you had purchased a CDROM set instead of doing an alternate
form of install.  The instructions for doing an ftp (or other style
of) install are very similar; the CDROM instructions are left intact
so that you can see how much easier it would have been if you had
purchased a CDROM instead.
<p>

<hr>
Please refer to the following files on the three CDROMs for extensive
details on how to install OpenBSD 3.0 on your machine:
<p>
<ul>
<li>	CD1:3.0/i386/INSTALL.i386
<li>	CD1:3.0/alpha/INSTALL.alpha
<p>
<li>	CD2:3.0/macppc/INSTALL.macppc
<li>	CD2:3.0/mvme68k/INSTALL.mvme68k
<li>	CD2:3.0/amiga/INSTALL.amiga
<li>	CD2:3.0/mac68k/INSTALL.mac68k
<li>	CD2:3.0/hp300/INSTALL.hp300
<li>	CD2:3.0/vax/INSTALL.vax
<p>
<li>	CD3:3.0/sparc/INSTALL.sparc
<li>	CD3:3.0/sparc64/INSTALL.sparc64
</ul>
<hr>

<p>
Quick installer information for people familiar with OpenBSD, and the
use of the "disklabel -E" command.  If you are at all confused when
installing OpenBSD, read the relevant INSTALL.* file as listed above!
<p>

<h3><font color=#e00000>OpenBSD/i386:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>
Play with your BIOS options to enable booting from a CD. The OpenBSD/i386 release is on CD1. If your BIOS does not support booting from CD, you will need to create a boot floppy to install from. To create a boot floppy write <i>CD1:3.0/i386/floppy30.fs</i> to a floppy and boot via the floppy drive.

<p>
Use <i>CD1:3.0/i386/floppyB30.fs</i> instead for greater scsi controller
support, or <i>CD1:3.0/i386/floppyC30.fs</i> for better laptop support.

<p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to read the included INSTALL.i386 document.

<p>
To make a boot floppy under MS-DOS, use the &quot;rawrite&quot; utility located at <i>CD:/3.0/tools/rawrite.exe</i>. To make the boot floppy under a Unix OS, use the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&sektion=1">dd(1)</a> utility. The following is an example usage of <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&sektion=1">dd(1)</a>, where the device could be &quot;floppy&quot;, &quot;rfd0c&quot;, or &quot;rfd0a&quot;.

<ul><pre>
# <strong>dd if=&lt;file&gt; of=/dev/&lt;device&gt; bs=32k</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
Make sure you use properly formatted perfect floppies with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install will most likely fail. For more information on creating a boot floppy and installing OpenBSD/i386 please refer to <a href="faq/faq4.html#4.1">FAQ4.1</a>.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color=#e00000>OpenBSD/alpha:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>
At the SRM prompt, enter <i>boot -fi 3.0/alpha/bsd.rd dka6</i> where <i>dka6</i>
is the short name for the CDROM drive (you can check with <i>show dev</i>).

<p>If you can't boot from CDROM, write <i>CD1:3.0/alpha/floppy30.fs</i> or
<i>CD1:3.0/alpha/floppyB30.fs</i> (depending on your machine) to a diskette and
enter <i>boot dva0</i>. Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install will most likely fail.

</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color=#e00000>OpenBSD/macppc:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>
Put the CD2 in your CDROM drive and poweron your machine while holding down the
<i>C</i> key until the display turns on and shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/3.0/macppc/bsd.rd</i>
<p>
Due to an error in how the CD was produced for the 3.0 Release,
the following modified command should be used: <i>boot cd:,OFWBOOT
/3.0/macppc/bsd.rd</i>.
This command may not work on some older New World systems,
iMac (Rev A - Rev C); on these machines it will be necessary to
copy the ofwboot and /3.0/macppc/bsd.rd to the first HFS partition on
the harddrive and boot using <i>boot hd:,OFWBOOT /bsd.rd</i>.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color=#e00000>OpenBSD/hp300:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>
Put the CD2 in your CDROM drive and press the spacebar during the poweron
self-test. Enter the boot choice that corresponds to <i>SYS_CDBOOT</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, you can boot over the network by following the instructions in
INSTALL.hp300.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color=#e00000>OpenBSD/amiga:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>
Create BSD partitions according to INSTALL.amiga's preparation section.
Mount the CD2 under AmigaOS as device CD0: Next, execute the following
CLI command: "CD0:3.0/amiga/utils/loadbsd CD0:3.0/amiga/bsd.rd".
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color=#e00000>OpenBSD/mac68k:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>
Boot MacOS as normal and partition your disk with the appropriate A/UX
configurations.  Then, extract the Macside utilities from
CD2:3.0/mac68k/utils onto your hard disk.  Run Mkfs to create your
filesystems on the A/UX partitions you just made.  Then, use the
BSD/Mac68k Installer to copy all the sets in CD2:3.0/mac68k/ onto your
partitions.  Finally, you will be ready to configure the BSD/Mac68k
Booter with the location of your kernel and boot the system.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color=#e00000>OpenBSD/mvme68k:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>
You can create a bootable installation tape or boot over the network.<br>
The network boot requires a MVME68K BUG version that supports the <i>NIOT</i>
and <i>NBO</i> debugger commands. Follow the instructions in INSTALL.mvme68k
for more details.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color=#e00000>OpenBSD/vax:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>
Boot over the network via mopbooting as described in INSTALL.vax.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color=#e00000>OpenBSD/sparc:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>
The 3.0 release of OpenBSD/sparc is located on CD3. To boot off of this CD you can use one of the two commands listed below, depending on the version of your ROM.

<ul><pre>
> <strong>boot cdrom 3.0/sparc/bsd.rd</strong>
or
> <strong>b sd(0,6,0)3.0/sparc/bsd.rd</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
If your sparc does not have a CD drive, you can alternatively boot from floppy. To do so you need to write &quot;CD3:3.0/sparc/floppy30.fs&quot; to a floppy. For more information see <a href="faq/faq4.html#4.1">FAQ4.1</a>. To boot from the floppy use one of the two commands listed below, depending on the version of your ROM.

<ul><pre>
> <strong>boot floppy</strong>
or
> <strong>boot fd()</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install will most likely fail.

<p>
If your sparc doesn't have a floppy drive nor a CD drive, you can either
setup a bootable tape, or install via network, as told in the
INSTALL.sparc file.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color=#e00000>OpenBSD/sparc64:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>
Put the CD3 in your CDROM drive and type <i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>CD3:3.0/sparc64/floppy30.fs</i> to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>.<br>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>CD3:3.0/sparc64/miniroot30.fs</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color=#e00000>Notes about the source code:</font></h3>
<ul>
<p>
src.tar.gz contains a source archive starting at /usr/src.  This file
contains everything you need except for the kernel sources, which are
in a separate archive.  To extract:
<p>
<ul><pre>
# <strong>mkdir -p /usr/src</strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/src</strong>
# <strong>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</strong>
</pre></ul>
<p>
srcsys.tar.gz contains a source archive starting at /usr/src/sys.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<p>
<ul><pre>
# <strong>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/src</strong>
# <strong>tar xvfz /tmp/srcsys.tar.gz</strong>
</pre></ul>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described at <a href=anoncvs.html>http://www.OpenBSD.org/anoncvs.html</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.
<p>
</ul>
<a name=ports></a>
<hr>
<p>
<h3><font color=#0000e0>Ports Tree</font></h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<p>
<ul><pre>
# <strong>cd /usr</strong>
# <strong>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</strong>
# <strong>cd ports</strong>
</pre></ul>
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> subdirectory is a checkout of the OpenBSD ports tree.  Go
read <a href=ports.html>http://www.OpenBSD.org/ports.html</a>
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
Certainly, the OpenBSD ports system is not complete.  It is doubtful it
will ever be. However, it is growing very fast and getting more stable.
Almost all ports provided with this release should build without problems
on most architectures (over 1200 packages build on i386, for instance).
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS (see the manpage for 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cvs&apropos=0&sektion=1&manpath=OpenBSD+Current&arch=i386&format=html">
cvs(1)</a> if 
you aren't familiar with CVS) checkout of our ports.  As with our complete 
source tree, our ports tree is available via anoncvs.  So, in
order to keep current with it, you must make the <i>ports/</i> tree
available on a read-write medium and update the tree with a command
like:
<p>
<ul><pre>
# <strong>cd [portsdir]/; cvs -d anoncvsserver.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_3_0</strong>
</pre></ul>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the local directory and server name here
with the location of your ports collection and a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages through ftp. Updated
packages for the 3.0 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list ports@openbsd.org is a good
place to know.
