<h2>OpenBSD</h2>

<hr>
The OpenBSD project involves continuing development of a multiplatform
4.4BSD-based Unix-like operating system.

<p>
OpenBSD looks a lot like NetBSD (which it is derived from, following
the 4.4BSD roots), but is now being developed seperately.  Good changes
from other free operating systems will be merged in (of course, depending
on various factors like developer time for example.)

<h3><hr>Platforms currently supported.</h3>

Note: for some of these platforms, the platform-independent code may
be identical to that found in NetBSD because there isn't a specific
OpenBSD developer. For other ports the differences are significant.
If you find an empty page that means nothing of consequence that is
directly port-specific has changed from NetBSD. (Of course there are
differences, but they just aren't in the /sys/arch/XXXX directory).

<h3><hr>Binary Snapshots.</h3>
Snapshots will be made available from time to time in the following
directories:<p>
<ul>
<li><a href=ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots>
ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots</a><br>
located at Rutgers University, eastern USA.
<!-- davem@openbsd.org -->
<li><a href=ftp://ftp.ibp.fr/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots>
ftp://ftp.ibp.fr/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/</a><br>
located in France.
<!-- ftpmaint@ftp.ibp.fr -->
<li><a href=ftp://hal.cs.umr.edu/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots>
ftp://hal.cs.umr.edu/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/</a><br>
located in University of Missouri-Rolla, mid-western USA.
<!-- johns@cs.umr.edu -->
</ul>
You should also read the <a href=snapshots.html>
general description about OpenBSD snapshots</a>.

<p>
The page for each platform (listed above) provides a link to the
specific snapshot ftp area, as well as other information you might
find neccessary or handy.

<h3><hr>How we help developers and users.</h3>
We are moving quickly to setup `infrastructure'... as things get working
this section will be updated.

<dl>
<dt><h4>Mailing Lists:</h4>
<dd>Some mailing lists are used for the development and use of OpenBSD.
In each case, send mail to
<a href=mailto:majordomo@OpenBSD.org>majordomo@OpenBSD.org</a>
with a message body of "<strong>subscribe mailing-list-name</strong>".
<p>
These are the mailing lists:
<dl>
<dt><strong>announce</strong>
<dd>important announcements. Since this is a low volume list
it is excellent for people who just want to follow important events.
<dt><strong>tech</strong>
<dd>technical discussions
<dt><strong>misc</strong>
<dd>user questions and answers
<dt><strong>source-changes</strong>
<dd>automated mailout of CVS source tree changes
</ul>
<p>
For further assistance, send a message body of "<strong>help</strong>",
and you will receive a reply outlining all your options.

<dt><h4>FTP:</h4>
<dd>This is a list of currently known ftp servers:<p>
<ul>
<li><a href=ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD>
ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD</a><br>
located at Rutgers University, eastern USA.
<!-- davem@openbsd.org -->
<li><a href=ftp://ftp.ibp.fr/pub/OpenBSD>
ftp://ftp.ibp.fr/pub/OpenBSD</a><br>
located in France.
<!-- ftpmaint@ftp.ibp.fr -->
<li><a href=ftp://hal.cs.umr.edu/pub/OpenBSD>
ftp://hal.cs.umr.edu/pub/OpenBSD</a><br>
located in University of Missouri-Rolla, mid-western USA.
<!-- johns@cs.umr.edu -->
</ul>
<p>

The file structure of the FTP servers is as follows:
<p>
<strong><dl>
<dt>pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/
<dt>pub/OpenBSD/src/
</dl>
</strong>
<p>

If you add a new FTP mirror site, please contact
<a href=mailto:deraadt@theos.com> the FTP maintainer</a>.

<dt><h4>SUP:</h4>
<dd>Sorry, SUP is not ready for use yet.

<dt><h4>CVS Access:</h4>
<dd>CVS is used to manage the OpenBSD source tree. This allows
developers to work on a local source tree and commit their changes when
ready.  Also <strong>anyone</strong> can edit source files on their
local machines, and automatically track and merge in any changes made
in the OpenBSD CVS repository. Additionally they can easily see the
logs of, check out, or "diff" the source files in the OpenBSD source
tree.
<p>

CVS is available at <a href=ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/cvs-1.6.tar.gz>
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/cvs-1.6.tar.gz</a>. Versions earlier
than 1.6 are not recommended, and may not work.<p>

There are two levels of source tree access:<p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Read-write access for developers</strong>
<dd>Developers who need to commit changes to the source tree must have
an account on the OpenBSD machines.  Getting this access will be a
natural result of working on the sources with other OpenBSD developers.
<p>
The OpenBSD cvs server is in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. 
<p>
<dt><strong>Read-only access for everyone</strong>
<dd>Anyone can access the read-only CVS repositories. These copies
of the read-write CVS repository are mirrored often. To use one,
set your <strong>CVSROOT</strong> environment variable to one of
the following values:
<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CVSROOT=anoncvs@anoncvs.openbsd.org:/cvs</strong><br>
located at Washington University, St. Louis, mid-west USA.<br>
protocols: rsh, ssh, ssh port 2022.<br>
updated every 4 hours.
<li><strong>CVSROOT=anoncvs@hal.cs.umr.edu:/cvs</strong><br>
located at University of Missouri-Rolla, Rolla, MO, mid-west USA.<br>
protocols: ssh, ssh port 2022.<br>
unknown update frequency.
</ul>
</dl>
<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong>
There are a few issues relating to cryptographic software that everyone
should be aware of:
<ul>
<li>The OpenBSD sources are from Canada. It is legal to export crypto
software from Canada to the world.
<li>However, if you are outside the USA or Canada, you should not
fetch the cryptographic sections of the OpenBSD sources from an
anoncvs server located in the USA. The files in question are...
<ul>
<li>src/kerberosIV/*
<li>src/lib/libc/crypt/crypt.c
<li>src/lib/libc/crypt/morecrypt.c
</ul>
Because of the USA ITAR munitions list,
crypto software may only be exported to Canada from the USA.
<li><strong>At the moment all the anoncvs servers are in the USA.
OpenBSD is looking for people willing to run an anoncvs server
in Europe!</strong>
</ul>
<p>
A sample use of an anoncvs CVS server would be:
<pre>
% setenv CVSROOT anoncvs@anoncvs.openbsd.org:/cvs
% cd /tmp
% cvs get sparc
[copies the files from the repository to your machine]
% cvs log sparc/sparc/locore.s
[shows the commit log for the chosen file ]
% cvs diff -bc -r1.1 -r1.5 sparc/sparc/locore.s
[shows the changes between revisions 1.1 and rev 1.5]
</pre>
The CVS man page (included with the CVS sources) has much more
information about how CVS can be used.<p>
<p>
The anoncvs service gives fledgling developers a chance to learn CVS
operation and get thoroughly involved in the development process
before getting "commit" access -- as a result of showing useful
skills and high quality results they will naturally later be given
developer access.
As well, people providing patches can create their "diff"s relative
to the CVS tree, which will ease integration.<p>

<p>
The CVS client uses rsh to talk to the CVS server.
If some local security measure like a firewall (or imperfect protocol
emulators like slirp) prevents you from using rsh, you may be able
to use <a href=http://www.cs.hut.fi/ssh>ssh</a> instead (If you are
running Solaris, there is a kernel bug which causes problems -- contact
johns@cs.umr.edu for further details).  In this case, one sets the
environment variable <strong>CVS_RSH</strong> to point to ssh
(typically <strong>/usr/local/bin/ssh</strong>). To reduce the
performance hit the anoncvs server would take it is recommended
(and requested) that you disable encryption.  If your local site
prevents you from connecting out to port 22 (which ssh defaults to
using) use port 2022.

<p>
Do not be tempted to turn on compression since CVS already compresses.
Use something like the following in your <strong>$HOME/.ssh/config</strong>
file.
<pre>
	Host anoncvs.openbsd.org
	    Cipher none
	    Port 2022
</pre>
If you wish to be a new anoncvs mirror site, please contact
<a href=mailto:deraadt@theos.com>the anoncvs maintainer</a>.
Anoncvs mirrors require about 250MB of disk, and use up to 8MB of swap
per anoncvs user (assuming the user does a large operation; while smaller
operations use fewer resources, anoncvs still makes much more of an
impact than ftp or sup). Such anoncvs machines should have excellent
network connectivity for the area they are expected to serve.<p>

A few places run OpenBSD... you can see them described in the
