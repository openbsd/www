Goals
</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Our goal is to make NTP ubiquitous by providing a free simple implementation
that is secure and easy to configure.

<ul>
<li>Be as <b>secure</b> as possible. Code carefully, do strict
    validity checks especially in the network input path, and use
    bounded buffer operations. Use privilege separation to mitigate
    the effects of possible security bugs.

<li>Provide a <b>lean</b> implementation, sufficient for a
    majority.  Don't try to support each and every obscure usage
    case, but cover the typical ones.

<li>Try to <b>&quot;Just Work&quot;</b> in the background.

<li>Work with just a <b>minimum of configuration</b>.

<li>Interoperate in the best possible way with the
    <a href="http://www.pool.ntp.org/en/">NTP pools</a>
    cluster, by supporting DNS lookups safely.

<li>Reach a <b>reasonable accuracy</b>. Do not sacrifice secure
    design for getting that last nanosecond or obscure edge case.

</ul>
