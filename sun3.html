<hr>

<p>
OpenBSD/sun3 runs on the Motorola 68020-based Sun3 computers, except for the
3/E flavour and the 3/50.
</p>

<p>
<strong><font color="#e00000">The OpenBSD/sun3 port has been
discontinued</font></strong> after the 2.9 release.
</p>

<p>
There is currently no one working on bringing this port back to life.
The source code is still available in the CVS Attic, and code can be found in
NetBSD as well.
If you are interested in reviving the sun3 port, make it work and contact
<a href="mailto:miod@openbsd.org">Miod Vallat</a>.

<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>History:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
The Sun3 port of OpenBSD was derived from the NetBSD/sun3 port, when the
sun3 and sun3x ports were still different entities. Noone showed much
interest in OpenBSD/sun3 for a while, although the code was mostly kept in
sync with NetBSD.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, Kenneth Stailey started working on the port, but since he was
living in the USA, he could not export a release he would have built, so he
lost interest working on this port.
</p>

<p>
Early 2000, Miod Vallat attempted to bring the port back in shape, making
the code compile again, and devising completely new installation media. The
port even shipped with complete X Window System client and utilities, although
there was no working X server.
</p>

<p>
The port lived for a few releases, but unfortunately hardware problems and
lack of time conspired to prevent catching up with NetBSD on code, and the
sun3 code was not ready for the switch from the old Mach virtual memory
system to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=uvm&amp;sektion=9">uvm</a>,
and missed the 3.0 release, hoping that the code would be fixed in time
for the 3.1 release. Unfortunately, this has not been the case, and eventually
it was decided to remove the code from the tree.

<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>Supported hardware:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
<h4>Supported models</h4>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>3/60, 3/60LE
  <li>3/75, 3/140, 3/150, 3/160 and 3/180
  <li>3/110
  <li>3/260 and 3/280

OpenBSD will not run on 3/160 family machines with only 2MB of memory,
and very hardly on 4MB machines whichever the model is.

<p>
<h4>Supported peripherals</h4>
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>On-board serial ports
<li>Sun type 3 keyboard and mouse
<li>On-board or VME video (bwtwo, cgtwo, cgfour)
<li>On-board or VME ethernet (intel, lance)
<li>On-board or VME sun-3 SCSI controller, currently with some limitations
